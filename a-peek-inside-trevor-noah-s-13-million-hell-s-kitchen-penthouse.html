In 2012, he shifted base to America when he became the first South African stand-up comedian to perform on a late-night talk show host. <a href=#>After contributing to </a><a href=#><i>The Daily Show With Jon Stewart</i></a>, Noah was announced as the new host in 2015. With his soaring career as a talk-show host, Trevor Noah found worldwide fame through his comedy tours at international locations.&nbsp;<a href=#>Throughout his career, Noah has amassed a massive $100 million fortune.</a></p><p>Trevor Noah has varied interests where he spent his millions, including a watch collection, expensive cars, and real estate. As the former host of <i>The Daily Show</i> has officially stepped back from his hosting duties, he has put his New York home for sale for $13 million. Noah’s home for five years, let’s look inside Trevor Noah’s $13 million penthouse in Hell’s Kitchen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-house-deeply-rooted-in-new-york-s-history>A House Deeply Rooted In New York’s History</h2><p>Ralph Thomas Walker, dubbed one of the best architects the world has ever seen, designed the building in the 1920s. Used for commercial purposes, architectural firm CetraRuddy converted the building into flats in 2014 via a collaboration with Jarvis Studio to redecorate the interiors. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scmp</a>, the building was named Stella Towers after Walker’s wife. The building is located in one of the <a href=#>most central locations in New York</a>, with direct views of Hudson Yards, the Lincoln Center, and Central Park.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside Ryan Seacrest’s $51 Million Beverly Hills home</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The three-bedroom duplex is near the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood, and Noah purchased the property in 2017 for $13 million. The property has been renovated since he moved into the place. Spanning 3,600 square feet, his penthouse is located on the 17th and 18th floors of the building. The duplex offers stunning views from the floor-to-ceiling windows and a floating staircase connecting the two floors. The 15-foot ceilings of the home are enhanced with ample natural lighting inside and French oak flooring. Additionally, the structure support between each room features tall cast-metal archways for a stunning look, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>.</p><h2 id=the-architectural-brilliance>The Architectural Brilliance</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The living room showcases a linear marble fireplace with a tufted sofa and armchairs positioned in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows. The adjoining dining area has butter yellow dining chairs that animate the decor of the formal room, while the dining table is made from polished wood. An expansive island separates the dining area from the kitchen. The kitchen is designed perfectly with veined polished marble and white oak. Soignée Verre églomisé glass panels cover one of the walls, while the kitchen provides a Sub-Zero refrigerator and a four-bottle wine tap. The kitchen also features marble flooring and cabinets.</p><p>The three suites are located on the lower level of Noah’s duplex. Each of the two guest rooms comes with an ensuite bathroom. One of the bedrooms has been converted into a screening room to add another recreational space inside the penthouse. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>, the Primary Suite has a suede-covered wall, a windowed dressing room, a walk-in closet, and a limestone flooring ensuite bathroom. Along with a private foyer, Noah’s bedroom also features automatic lighting for increased comfort.</p><h2 id=the-indoor-outdoor-perfection>The Indoor-Outdoor Perfection</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The penthouse is a recreational space on the 18th floor</a>, which serves as the upper level. It features an expansive living room along with a den. The den features a foosball table and leads directly onto the terrace. Various seating areas inside the den are made from various materials, including leather and suede. As the home is located at a peak height, there are unobstructed views from each corner of the duplex that allows plenty of sunlight to enter everywhere.</p><p>The den spills into the outdoors with French doors that open onto the expansive terrace. The 1,000-square-foot private terrace is customized to perfection. It features a heated plunge pool with built-in speakers and a custom teak pergola, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robb Report</a>. Noah has also installed a black granite wet bar with an al fresco kitchen at one end of the terrace. The outdoor décor is softened with potted plants that run along the length of the terrace, and the hurricane-protected candles glow the skyline during the later hours of the day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with the penthouse being an architectural dream, it was also an efficient commute for Trevor Noah as it was located just a few blocks away from the set of <i>The Daily Show</i>. In November 2022, he put the house on sale for $13 million as he plans to travel the world after leaving the show in December.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The LolaVie Story: Here's How Jennifer Aniston Grew Her Haircare Brand</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scmp</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robb Report</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaaZaCasqx5yKeqopyVYsGzsdWoqWamn5a1tHmQbGSmoZyhtrC6jKGcpaSjYriqwMKhnKdloJq7tbTOrqqeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-was-sean-lampkin-tributes-pour-in-as-nipsey-from-martin-dies-aged-54.html><span>←</span><span>Who was Sean Lampkin?
