When the Los Angeles native asked her daughter what she was teaching her grandmother, Chanel said she was “twerking.”</p><p>The model asked, “Twerking? You’re teaching Mom how to twerk? Oh, my God. This is what you do when family’s over. Oh, my gosh.”</p><p>Coco continued <a href=# rel=noopener>filming their dancing</a> as Chanel’s cousins joined in, writing, “What’s going on here?”</p><p>The former reality star welcomed her and the 63-year-old rapper’s daughter in 2015. The couple have made headlines for their parenting choices over the years, primarily concerning Coco’s choice to continue breast-feeding the little one.</p><p><a href=#>Coco defended nursing</a> in July, exclusively telling Us Weekly at the time: “Chanel still likes my boobs. It’s a big bonding moment for a mother and your child. Why take that away from her? … If she doesn’t want it, all right, that’s where you stop it. But I’m not just going to say no.”</p><p>She went on to write via Twitter that she felt “wanted” when Chanel breast-fed. “Getting lots of love from the mamas on my social media platforms that understand the ‘boob thing.’ Thanks,” Coco wrote. “The feeling of this bond is indescribable.”</p><p>Later that same week, Ice-T tweeted, “News Flash! We feed Chanel FOOD. She just likes to suck mom’s boob every now and then. Me Too!!! <a href=#>News Flash! I’m still breast-feeding!</a> Every chance I can. … Why the F are you worried about MY Child??? That’s what’s weird. Now go back in the basement.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When the couple, who wed in 2005 in California, spoke exclusively to Us about their toddler in September 2019, the Law & Order: SVU star clarified that Chanel loves burgers and chili fries.</p><p>“She only breast-feeds … like, when she cries [and] she just wants to get close to her mama,” the New Jersey native said. “She throws the boob out and … holds on. She’s not doing it for nourishment.”</p><p>His wife chimed in at the time: “Nursing is about giving love to your child and <a href=#>bonding with your child</a> and also giving them good nutrition. Breast milk is like liquid gold. All around, it’s a good thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaim5ViwW6vzpymZpmlqMGqutJmm5qtl53Bpr6MnJ%2BappWherWxwJyfnqtdnL%2BiusOmmGasn2LBuLHRpGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./benito-castro-parents-meet-arturo-castro-rosaura-hern%C3%A1ndez.html><span>←</span><span>Benito Castro parents: Meet Arturo Castro &amp;amp; Rosaura Hernndez</span></a>
