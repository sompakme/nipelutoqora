There's a constant need to stay up-to-date with what they're doing, what they're wearing, and who they're talking about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When celebrities talk about each other, the public is usually fascinated with what their feelings are. A lot of times, people can overanalyze certain statements and start a beef where there is none. Other times, very blatant <a href=#>shade</a> gets thrown by certain celebrities. This shade can be thrown via an interview, an award show, or a social media post.</p><p>Here are eight moments when celebrities couldn't resist throwing a bit of <a href=#>shade</a> at their fellow celebrities.</p><h2 id=madonna-calls-lady-gaga-39-s-born-this-way-39-reductive-39><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Madonna Calls Lady Gaga's Born This Way 'Reductive'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Lady Gaga burst onto the scene in 2008, many were comparing her to Madonna. The Queen of Pop had nice things to say about Gaga, even <a href=#>taking her daughter Lourdes to one of her concerts</a> in 2009. When Gaga released "Born This Way," many felt it was too similar to Madonna's "Express Yourself." When Madonna was asked about this in 2012, she was complimentary toward Gaga, but said that the song's similarities were "reductive." This set off rumors of a feud between the two stars. <a href=#>Madonna later told Rolling Stone</a> in 2015 that she didn't have an issue with Gaga and her criticism was only with the song. <a href=#>Madonna and Gaga were later photographed together</a> at an Oscar after-party in 2019.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Taylor Swift's Midnights Album Release Date Subtly Shading Kim Kardashian?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mariah-carey-avoids-a-question-about-eminem><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mariah Carey Avoids A Question About Eminem</span></h2><p>Mariah Carey and Eminem were rumored to be dating in the early 2000s. Eminem would claim that the two had a relationship and Carey later denied this was true. Eminem would go on to insult Carey in songs and on stage for years. <a href=#>Carey even referenced the situation</a> in her song "Clown" from her "Charmbracelet" album. Her hit song "Obsessed" is also rumored to be about him. When asked about Eminem on an episode of Watch What Happens Live, Carey perfectly avoided Andy Cohen's question with a hint of shade.</p><h2 id=whitney-houston-says-she-doesn-39-t-think-of-mariah-carey><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Whitney Houston Says She Doesn't Think Of Mariah Carey</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Mariah Carey came out with her first album, many people compared her to Whitney Houston. <a href=#>Carey herself said</a> that she hoped people would one day see her as her own artist. Houston was asked about Carey at the time and when asked what she thinks of her, Houston famously said, "I don't think of her." It may or may not have been meant as shade, but it certainly came across that way. The two would later put any drama behind them when collaborating on The Prince of Egypt theme "When You Believe." The two became friends and <a href=#>Carey honored Houston at the BET Awards</a> after her death.</p><h2 id=cher-has-some-choice-words-for-madonna><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Cher Has Some Choice Words For Madonna</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to women in popular music, Cher might be the only other female artist to truly rival Madonna. In terms of longevity and legendary status, the two of them are in a class by themselves. However, there wasn't always such warmth between the two of them. In an interview, Cher once talked about a time when Madonna came over her house and was very rude. In a later interview, Cher elaborates on that interview and said that Madonna isn't talented or beautiful. She also used a word that many women would find incredibly offensive. <a href=#>The two were later photographed together</a> during the Women's March in 2017.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kendall Jenner Shades Kylie’s Kids As The Best “Birth Control”</a></span></p><h2 id=christina-aguilera-dismisses-eminem-on-stage><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Christina Aguilera Dismisses Eminem On Stage</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eminem and Christina Aguilera were in a bitter feud in the 2000s. Eminem took issue with the way <a href=#>she spoke about his relationship with his ex-wife</a> on MTV. This led to Eminem dissing Aguilera in songs and interviews. During the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Aguilera presented with Britney Spears. The two were listing off names of artists they met while at the show. When Spears mentioned Eminem, Aguilera rolled her eyes and said, "Anyway." It was a very subtle form of shade that spoke volumes. Aguilera would later present Eminem with an award at the 2002 VMAs.</p><h2 id=naomi-campbell-feuding-with-tyra-banks><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Naomi Campbell Feuding With Tyra Banks</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When most people think about fashion models who paved the way for Black women, Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks are usually the first two people who come to mind. Banks has recalled that when she was first starting out, the media tried to pit the two women against each other. Banks has said that while she felt this comparison was unfair to both of them, <a href=#>she was disappointed in Campbell's reaction</a> to it. While the two seemed to patch things up during Banks' talk show, Campbell shared an article on Twitter calling Banks "the real mean girl" in 2016. <a href=#>Campbell later spoke highly of Banks</a> during her Watch What Happens Live appearance.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Christina Haack Denies 'Throwing Shade' At Her Exes Following A Recent Instagram Post</a></span></p><h2 id=prince-takes-a-swipe-at-justin-timberlake><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Prince Takes A Swipe At Justin Timberlake</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prince was not one to mince words or hide his opinions. Justin Timberlake soared into 2006 with his "FutureSex/LoveSounds" album. The hit single "SexyBack" was a huge hit and marked the return of Timberlake as a pop star. However, not everyone was a fan of the song. Prince, in particular, was not feeling it and made his feelings known on stage. <a href=#>While performing at an Emmys party</a>, Prince reportedly told the crowd, "For whoever is claiming that they are bringing sexy back, sexy never left!"</p><p>Timberlake would later pay tribute to Prince by performing a cover of his song "I Would Die 4 U" during his Super Bowl halftime show.</p><h2 id=janet-jackson-disses-madonna-on-television><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Janet Jackson Disses Madonna On Television</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Janet Jackson released her breakthrough album "Control" in 1986, Madonna already established herself as a pop culture icon. Many have compared the two stars over the years and Jackson was asked about the Queen of Pop in 1993. When asked if she felt she was going "head-to-head" with Madonna, Jackson said that what she did "has class to it." <a href=#>Jackson later told Vibe magazine</a> in 1994 that she didn't hate her, but if she did, she would "have valid reasons to." <a href=#>Madonna later defended Jackson</a> on the Grammy Awards red carpet in 2004 following the infamous Super Bowl halftime wardrobe malfunction. <a href=#>Jackson also expressed excitement</a> about Madonna's halftime show in 2012.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmKR6tbTRnq5mq5iWsaZ5wK1knpmTnXqwwMeeqWahnmK2r8DEq62inaeofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-wrestlers-with-a-bad-reputation-for-making-mistakes.html><span>←</span><span>15 Wrestlers With A Bad Reputation For Making Mistakes</span></a>
