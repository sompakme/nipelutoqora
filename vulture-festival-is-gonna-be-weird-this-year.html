But this time around, as Hollywood presses forward through an era of great change, we decided to get a little weird with it! Specifically, we’re welcoming <strong>“Weird Al” Yankovic</strong> himself to our pop-culture extravaganza for the very first time. We’ll also be celebrating the song of the summer: “Sitting” (which is the opposite of standing) with <strong>Brian Jordan Alvarez</strong> for a live chat with <strong>TJ Mack and his wife. </strong>You can also join us for an intimate evening with <strong>Adam Pally</strong>. <strong>Amber Tamblyn</strong> is bringing us a lineup of feminist authors to feed our brains, <strong>Matt Rogers</strong> is returning to once again make sure we’ve heard of Christmas, and <strong>Henry Winkler</strong> is going to share some lessons on the craft of acting. Finally, director and writer <strong>Cord Jefferson </strong>will join us for a big long talk about his film American Fiction, but wait! There will be more! The schedules are still being ironed out and the details finalized, but soon we will be announcing even more opportunities to hobnob with your cultural faves live and in person.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnt493jq000c3b7ji0oltddz@published data-word-count=3><a href=#><strong>Get tickets here!</strong></a></p><p class=slug data-editable=subsectionSlug>Music</p><h2 class=title><span class=_weird>Weird </span><span class=_al>Al </span><span class=_superlatives>Superlatives </span><span class=_live>Live!</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f7d/d0e/1f7aa029df9427b319fc75f450e0ca0855-VF23-Brian-Jordan-Alvarez-3-1080x1080.rsquare.w570.png><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnt2t47f004j3b7hqj3szvj9@published data-word-count=68>What’s your favorite Weird Al song? Everyone has one, even the man himself.
