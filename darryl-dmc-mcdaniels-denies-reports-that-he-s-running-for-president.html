The 59 year-old <a href=# id=auto-tag_run-dmc-2 data-tag=run-dmc-2>Run-DMC</a> member has clarified comments he made over the weekend regarding his plans for a Presidential bid in 2024, explaining that the remarks were taken out of context.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“That’s so funny,” the Queens native <a rel=nofollow href=#>told AllHipHop</a> of the thought of him campaigning for leadership of the country. He then seemingly threw a jab at media outlets that attributed his declaration that he was “running for president starting today” as anything beyond a humorous quip, as well as their failure to confirm or consider the source for accuracy.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“That’s why media today is a joke. They just run with anything before even confirming it. I would never run for president. I get more done as <a href=#>a representative of all people</a>. The point I was trying to make is the arts succeed where politics and religion fails,” he stated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1423154351.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On Aug. 27, Outkick, which is billed as a “right-wing and conservative sports news” outlet, <a rel=nofollow href=#>reported that </a>McDaniels had used his appearance at Lionel Messi’s Major League Soccer debut on Saturday (Aug. 26) to announce his intent to run for President. However, the rap icon says the remark was made in gest and distracted from the core of the message he attempted to convey, which was a call for unity.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The real world is when people who are from different races and cultures can come together at concerts, museums, plays, sporting events, restaurants, and comic cons,” he said. “This shows the unique, diverse, but universally connected world we live in. Politics and religion are used divisively, but events with art and performance bring us together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1180531936-1.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While McDaniels has nixed any speculation regarding his Presidential candidacy, Hip-Hop will still be represented in the 2024 Presidential Election, as veteran rapper Afroman has <a href=#>filed the official paperwork</a> required to enter the race. The Californian and cannabis advocate and connoisseur is running in hopes of legalizing marijuana nationally and contributing to social justice reform.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5mus77YpWSdpZNiuqSwwKegnqSjYrGmusieqmaqlaW8s8DSZqmupp6eu6h5z6ucrKGUmru1eZBram1vaGmFeX6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./corinne-olympios-is-still-friends-with-bip-producer-who-filed-complaint.html><span>←</span><span>Corinne Olympios Is Still Friends With BIP Producer Who Filed Complaint</span></a>
