I always woke up not knowing what to do with the day … I would just look across the street, see an Irish pub and be like, ‘That looks like fun.’”</p><p>The Jackass alum, who has <a href=#>struggled with addiction</a> for years, revealed that Marie changed him after she entered his life in June and helped him get sober two months later. “Now I wake up, I walk the dogs, I stretch, I go to the gym, I go skateboarding. Everything’s a structured fun schedule,” he said. “And we do it together, and it’s just a perfect thing.”</p><p>Margera gushed: “She’s everything I’ve ever asked for — I couldn’t ask for anything more. We are a perfect team.”</p><p>Margera was first linked to Marie in July after she started popping up on his two Instagram pages. He&nbsp;posted a picture with Marie <a href=# rel=noopener>in a grocery store</a> on July 4 via his @bam_margera account. Later that month, Margera <a href=# rel=noopener>attended the X Games</a> with Marie and shared snaps from the event via his @captaincremebrulee profile.</p><p>Margera once again gave fans a glimpse at his romance with Marie in September when he announced he had gotten sober. “Thanks to @danniimarieofficial for one month of sobriety and getting me happy, healthy and fit as well as the small circle of friends that have supported us,” he wrote <a href=# rel=noopener>via Instagram</a> at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jackass-Alum-Bam-Margera-Is-Engaged-to-Dannii-Marie-2.jpg><p>“He went through [detox] and I didn’t go anywhere,” Marie told Us of their strong bond. “We stayed in this beautiful crystal infested pool house where we just healed, all of us, and we shut the phones off. He didn’t have a phone. I changed his number and we just X’d the bad people and here we are.”</p><p>When Margera celebrated his birthday a week later, Marie honored him with <a href=# rel=noopener>a sweet Instagram message</a>. “Happy Birthday to this amazing, one-of-a-kind soul,” she wrote on September 28. “Words cannot express the connection and the bond we share. Keep after your goals and your eyes on the future. I am beyond proud of you, and I love being by your side. 🖤♥️💜🖤🫶🏼♾️🧊.”</p><p>Before going public with Marie, Margera dealt with several ups and downs in his personal life. He was married to childhood friend <strong>Melissa Rothstein</strong> in 2007, but the pair divorced in 2012. Margera moved on with <strong>Nicole Boyd</strong>, whom he wed in October 2013. The twosome <a href=#>welcomed their son</a>, Phoenix, in December 2017.</p><p>As Margera struggled with addiction over the next few years, he and Boyd split. Us confirmed in September 2021 that Boyd filed for primary legal and physical custody of their son. Boyd reportedly filed for a legal separation from Margera in February, according to multiple outlets. She was granted temporary sole custody of Phoenix last month.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Once Marie entered his life, everything started to fall into place. “Dannii [got] me on the right track,” Margera told Us on Wednesday. “Got me visitation to see my son Phoenix after not seeing him for 200 days.”</p><p>With reporting by Leanne Aciz Stanton</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZOgrrS%2FjJqjrqVdl66uecyaqaCdopZ6qr%2BMnqWgmZeasW7AzmabmqaenrZuucCroJ5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-strait-death-hoax-debunked-what-happened-to-him-and-where-is-he-now.html><span>←</span><span>George Strait Death Hoax Debunked What Happened To Him And Where Is He Now?</span></a>
