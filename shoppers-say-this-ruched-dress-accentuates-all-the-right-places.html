More often than not, we steer clear of bodycon dresses. We see the word, hiss and slink down into our chairs, hiding until it goes away. Now, don’t be mistaken; it’s not that we don’t like bodycon dresses. We actually like them a lot! The problem is when we actually put them on and they fit us in all of the wrong ways!"><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

We see the word, hiss and slink down into our chairs, hiding until it goes away. Now, don’t be mistaken; it’s not that we don’t like bodycon dresses. We actually like them a lot! The problem is when we actually put them on and they fit us in all of the wrong ways!</p><p>That all changes with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Stars Ruched Mididress</a>. It’s the first bodycon dress we’ve seen in a long time that actually instills confidence within us! With over 100 reviewers so far, this mididress is clearly making waves, and we’re riding those waves all the way to shore!</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Michael-Stars-Dress-Red.jpg alt="Michael Stars Dress Red" width=1000 height=1000 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Stars Ruched Mididress</a> for just<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $98</a> at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p>This dress is shocking so many skeptical shoppers who took it out the box and feared it would never fit. They were happy to be proven wrong, as this dress ended up fitting “perfectly” and accentuating “all the right places” on their body. One said they “would never have imagined that a fabric could ever fit like this,” while another called it “unbelievably comfortable and flattering.” One reviewer said they’ve spent up to $900 on designer dresses this year alone, but called this piece “one of the best dresses” they’ve purchased!</p><p>Shoppers are also loving how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this dress</a> can take them from looking lazy to snatched in seconds! One said they majorly appreciate how they can just pull this dress out of the closet at the very last minute and know they’ll “look fantastic.” So, why is that?</p><p>The ruching is a huge factor in the flattering fit of this mididress. We’ll find it at both sides, giving us a cinched silhouette, no matter what! Yes, we can actually exhale and relax in this bodycon dress while still looking flawlessly put-together!</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Michael-Stars-Dress-Oxide.jpg alt="Michael Stars Dress Oxide" width=1000 height=1000 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Stars Ruched Mididress</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$98</a> at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p>The fabric of this dress is also a factor, as it’s soft and stretchy, made of cotton with a hint of spandex. It’s also unlined, so we won’t have to constantly smooth out any unsightly bumps or lumps!</p><p>This dress has a scoop neckline, three-quarter-length sleeves and a straight hem that hits below the knees, lightly hugging them for a slim fit through and through. Remember, it’s stretchy, so this is a good thing! This stretch also helps when pulling this dress on or off, since it leaves bulky zippers, hooks and buttons in the dust.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This USA-made dress</a>&nbsp;is available in five colors, all of which are on the darker side for a favorable fit. We have Nocturnal, a super deep navy, Bayside, a more royal blue, Olive Moss, a soft, earthy green, Oxide, a dark grey-ish green and Ruby, an alluring red. Each and every color is equally as suitable for the club as it is for the office underneath a blazer or cardigan!</p><p>Michael Stars creates “luxury essentials that embody the modern California lifestyle” for anyone who wants to exude it. The brand’s “elevated assortment of clothing” is what makes it so loved by celebrities and shoppers everywhere, and this dress might be our favorite piece yet!</p><p>Any bodycon dress that makes us this excited gains automatic wardrobe staple status, and we can’t wait to rock this piece everywhere we go!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Stars Ruched Mididress</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$98</a> at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p><strong>Not your style?
