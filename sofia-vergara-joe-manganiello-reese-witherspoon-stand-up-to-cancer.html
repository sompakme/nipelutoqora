Mad Men’s<strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Jon Hamm</a></strong> specifically spoke about losing his mom to colon cancer when he was 10 years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tony-goldwyn.jpg><p>“Colon cancer is one of the most preventable kinds of cancer,” he said. “We are raising awareness. And what we can do to prevent cancer, to be well, to be healthy, to prevent it before it starts or catch it early.”&nbsp;</p><p>Pitch Perfect actress <strong>Hailee Steinfeld </strong>lost two family members to cancer —&nbsp;her grandfathers. “One was this June, and one in 2002,” she said. “I was very fortunate enough to grow up with them and have them in my life as long as I did, but going through that was not easy and watching my family go through that was not easy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jen-aniston-gwyneth-paltrow.jpg><p>Scandal’s <strong>Tony Goldwyn</strong> felt honored to be a part of the “extraordinary cause” after losing his mother to cancer. “I have other family members that are fighting it now and many close friends. It’s time to get something done,” he told reporters. Earlier, he posted a picture in his SU2C shirt via Instagram. “@tessmg36 & me headed to #StandUp2Cancer telecast!” he wrote.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Jennifer Aniston</a> </strong>presented at the show wearing a white T-shirt that listed loved ones she’s lost. “We have to keep rising as one because cancer keeps going after the ones we love,” she said. “This is just enough. We have the power to change this.”</p><p>Host <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Katie Couric</a> —</strong>&nbsp;who just lost her mom Elinor earlier this week —&nbsp;said it was “gratifying and overwhelming” to see the event grow since its 2008 debut. “To see all these celebrities come here, to see all the public support we’ve gotten to see you all here, it means the world to me,” she said. She also posted a picture with a cancer survivor before making her way to the theatre.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/katie-couric.jpg><p>Other stars in attendance included <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Rob Lowe</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kevin Bacon</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Anna Kendrick</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jessica Alba</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Halle Berry</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kerry Washington</strong></a>, <strong>Dane Cook</strong>, <strong>Josh Gad</strong>, <strong>Pierce Brosnan</strong>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jordana Brewster</strong></a>, <strong>Tony Hale</strong>, <strong>Rob Riggie</strong>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jennifer Hudson</strong></a>, and more.</p><p>All celebrities in attendance proudly wore SU2C T-shirts to raise awareness and rocked Orange ROAM with SU2C Ropes earphones.
