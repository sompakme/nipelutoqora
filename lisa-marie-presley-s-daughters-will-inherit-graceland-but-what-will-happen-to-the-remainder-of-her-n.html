However, several recent lawsuits and court filings suggest that her finances were not in good shape, as of the time of her divorce proceedings with her last husband, Michael Lockwood, she was $16 million in debt.</p><p>In 2016, Lisa Marie filed a lawsuit against her former business manager, Barry Siegel, alleging that he had mismanaged her finances and left her with only $14,000 despite inheriting over $100 million from her father's estate.

Additionally, in 2020, she put her home in England up for sale, which was listed for £3.35 million. While it is unclear how much Lisa Marie's outstanding debts were at the time of her death, the lawsuits and financial troubles suggest that her estate may not be as financially stable as it once was.</p><p>In fact, <a href=#>Lisa Marie's net worth at the time of her death was -$10 million</a>. This is because of the case of mismanaged assets, unpaid taxes, and a series of legal battles she was embroiled in before her death.
