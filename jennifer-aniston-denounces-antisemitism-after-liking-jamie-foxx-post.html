I did not ‘like’ this post on purpose or by accident,” Aniston, 54, wrote via her Instagram Story on Saturday, August 5. “And more importantly, I want to be clear to my friends and anyone hurt by this showing up in their feeds — I do NOT support antisemitism. And I truly don’t tolerate HATE of any kind. Period.”</p><p class=p1>Several hours earlier, Foxx, 55, posted a troubling message via his Instagram. “They killed this dude name Jesus … They’ll do to you???!” he wrote on both his Instagram and Instagram Story, alongside “Fake Friends” and “Fake Love” hashtags.</p><p class=p1>Foxx — who is <a href=#>currently recovering from an undisclosed medical complication</a> — was immediately met with backlash and was subsequently <a href=#>accused of spreading antisemitic rhetoric</a> to his social media followers. The Oscar winner has since deleted the post. In a screenshot captured by <a href=#>A Wider Frame</a> — which aims to share “current events in the Jewish world” — Aniston appeared to drop a “like” on the post. The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Friends</a>&nbsp;</i>alum also shared&nbsp;A Wider Frame’s upload in her Saturday message.</p><p class=p1>Foxx<a href=#> issued an apology</a> via Instagram on Saturday, August 5.</p><p class=p1>“I want to apologize to the Jewish community and everyone who was offended by my post. I now know my choice of words have caused offense and I’m sorry,” he wrote. “That was never my intent.”</p><p class=p1>He continued: “To clarify, I was betrayed by a fake friend and that’s what I meant with ‘they’ not anything more. I only have love in my heart for everyone. I love and support the Jewish community. My deepest apologies to anyone who was offended.&nbsp;<span class=s1>❤️</span>&nbsp;<span class=s1>❤️</span>&nbsp;<span class=s1>❤️</span>.”</p><p class=p1>Foxx’s social media scandal — and Aniston’s rebuttal — comes nearly one year after many stars came together to <a href=#>denounce similar antisemitic comments </a>made by <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>West, 45, initially shared <a href=#>troubling messages via Twitter and Instagram</a> about his desire to go “death con 3 [sic]” on individuals of Jewish faith in October 2022. After the platforms locked him out of his accounts and West <a href=#>lost many billion-dollar brand deals</a>, the rapper — who performed with Foxx on many songs including their “Gold Digger” duet in 2005 — <a href=#>apologized for his remarks</a>.</p><p class=p1>Amid the scandal, many A-listers<a href=#> denounced antisemitism and the recent rise of hate speech and attacks</a> on Jewish people.</p><p class=p1>“Antisemitism in any form is deplorable. In person. Online. Doesn’t matter where. It’s hate and it’s unacceptable,” <a href=#><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></a>, who costars with Aniston in&nbsp;<i><a href=#>The Morning Show</a>,&nbsp;</i>tweeted at the time. “Completely understand why my Jewish friends/ colleagues are frightened for their families. This is a very scary time.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Florence Pugh</strong></a>, for her part, wrote via Instagram: “Any form of hate speech only encourages, it grows and spreads like a disease. Any whisper of anti-semitism is dangerous and needs to be addressed and taken down.”</p><p class=p1>Foxx, for his part, declined to “speak ill” of <a href=#>his friend and collaborator</a> throughout the ordeal. “All those guys that you’re missing, every time I talk to them, I hold them up [and] I hold them down, I say, ‘Remember when we used to have fun and smile and be goofy?’” Foxx told <a href=#>TMZ</a> in November 2022 when asked about West’s scandal. “Let’s get back to that and the world will take care of [itself]. But, if we allow ourselves to stop having fun, especially on our side, then who’s gonna go for it. … We only got one life to live, there’s so much craziness.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jtqex0WaYp6GjqbyvecOepaitnpiytHnAp6uiq5WitrW10qZkmp6kmr9uuMikoKefXZ%2BurrXEZp2osKhivbC%2F02g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jd-drake-wrestlezone.html><span>←</span><span>JD Drake - Wrestlezone</span></a>
