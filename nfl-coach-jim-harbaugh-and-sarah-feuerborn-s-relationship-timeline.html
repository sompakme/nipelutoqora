With the older kids, people would tell me: ‘Don’t pressure them to play sports.’ And I really wanted them to play sports and be good at them,” Jim told <i><a href=# rel=noopener>GQ</a> </i>in a 2017 profile. “But I listened to what people were saying, ‘Don’t put a lot of pressure on them, to be a football player or an athlete.’ They find their own path.”</p><p class=p1>He added at the time, “And I just had an epiphany: with the 8-and-unders, I’m going to coach them like I do my own players. Not treat my kids any different than my own players, and not treat my players any different than my own kids.”</p><p class=p1>Keep scrolling for Jim and Sarah’s complete relationship timeline:</p><h3 class=p5><b>2006</b></h3><p class=p1>Jim and Sarah met in the parking lot of a PF Changs in Las Vegas shortly after he finalized his divorce from ex-wife Miah.</p><p class=p1>“Sarah was there getting takeout. I saw her get takeout and leaving, and I went up to her and asked if I could meet her,” he recalled during a 2015 interview on HBO’s <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Real Sports</i></a>. “She said, ‘Sure, you can meet me,’ and she gave me her phone number. I didn’t believe her at first, I thought it was one of those fake numbers.”</p><p class=p1>Jim noted that he reached out to Sarah “nine times” before she returned his phone call. “I could tell she was a winner all the way,” he gushed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/los-angeles-chargers-coach-jim-harbaugh-and-wife-sarah-feuerborn-harbaughs-relationship-timeline-02.jpg><h3 class=p5><b>January 2008</b></h3><p class=p1>After two years together, Jim and Sarah tied the knot.</p><h3 class=p5><b>2010</b></h3><p class=p1>During Jim’s tenure as the Stanford University <a href=#>football coach</a>, he gave Sarah a sweet shout-out during a <a href=# rel=noopener>press conference</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I was thinking just the other night that two people in my life, my wife and our quarterback, <strong>Andrew Luck</strong>, have a lot in common in that they’re just both perfect,” Jim quipped. “With most people you say, ‘If they only didn’t do that. Or they didn’t do this.’ Or you wish they could do this, or you wish they could do that. But I don’t do that with my wife Sarah or Andrew Luck. They are just absolutely perfect the way they are. For a football coach, that’s pretty great — to have a great wife and a great quarterback.”</p><p class=p1>One year later, he became the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers.
