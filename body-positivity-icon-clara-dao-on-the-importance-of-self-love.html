literally on children - and as an adult, you're</strong> [still]<strong> constantly bombarded with images and propaganda advertising, telling you you're not enough."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=clara-opens-up-about-falling-into-the-habit-of-comparing-herself-to-others>Clara Opens Up About Falling Into The Habit Of Comparing Herself To Others</h2><p><strong>"Before </strong>[I started my self-love journey]<strong>, I always compared myself, wished I looked different, and wished I would wake up with a different face and body," </strong>Clara shares.</p><p>She goes on to explain that much of that was fueled by the images she stuck onto her mirror: <strong>"I printed out pictures of 'perfect' bodies and </strong>[stuck them there]<strong>, because I just really wanted my body to look like that."</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Cardi B Defends Lizzo Against Cruel, Body Shaming Trolls</a></span></p><p><strong>"That was very toxic,"</strong> she sighs, adding, <strong>"it was very bad for my self-esteem and mental health." </strong>Another thing that added to poor mental health, Clara goes on, were the questions she would Google. <strong>"I would Google things like, 'why am I flat-chested?' </strong>[or] <strong>'what's wrong with me?'" </strong>she recalls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=clara-explains-why-poor-self-image-is-more-dangerous-than-we-tend-to-realize>Clara Explains Why Poor Self-Image Is More Dangerous Than We Tend To Realize</h2><p>There's no two ways about it: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">body shaming, no matter the body in question, has devastating consequences for the person going through it</a> — and that's something Clara is acutely aware of.</p><p><strong>"When you don't love yourself,"</strong> — or are taught not to — <strong>"you attract people who also don't really love or accept you, because you accept the love you think you deserve."</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Defend Gigi Hadid After She Was Targeted By Body Shaming Trolls</a></span></p><p><strong>"It really affects a lot of other things in your life, like the treatment you accept from others, and how you accept your life's circumstances,</strong>" she continues. <strong>"You accept whatever life gives you and don't realize there's more."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"That's why," </strong>she nods,<strong> "it's so important to spread a message of body positivity."</strong></p><h2 id=how-clara-is-using-social-media-for-good>How Clara Is Using Social Media For Good</h2><p>While the insecurity Clara faced as an adolescent was no doubt informed by the images she was exposed to in the media in her younger years, today, she uses her own images to combat the very standards that once destroyed her self-confidence.</p><p><strong>"I try my best to show more representation of my body type on social media,"</strong> she explains.</p><p><strong>"In a way," </strong>she wonders aloud, <strong>"I'm making the kind of content that the younger me would love to see."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I would love it if, when a young girl Googles the same things I was, my content would come up and I could comfort them -
