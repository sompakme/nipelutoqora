At least, Goldberg thought it was dirty enough to need a cleaning, according to news sources. She boxed up the award and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">returned it to the Academy for cleaning</a>, per AP News.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Does Whoopi Goldberg Get Paid To Host 'The View'?</a></span></p><p>The Academy, which used UPS to ship its parcels, received the Oscar from Whoopi. The next step was to ship the package to the manufacturer of the statues. Per news sources, the Academy boxed up Oscar and sent him on his way; he never made it. The box, however, did arrive -- empty, but resealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of this happened on a Friday, and no one knows what really happened. But per the Academy, the package was tampered with in a UPS shipping container.</p><p>So who were the thieves, and why did they kidnap Oscar?</p><h2 id=where-is-whoopi-goldberg-s-oscar-statue-now>Where Is Whoopi Goldberg's Oscar Statue Now?</h2><p>No one ever found out&nbsp;why thieves removed Whoopi Goldberg's Oscar from its package, then carefully resealed the box. They did, however, recover the statue not long after it went missing.</p><p>Goldberg's spokesman later revealed that the Oscar was found at an Ontario, California airport. In a strange twist, it wound up in the trash.</p><p>No further information was ever found out about who took the award, or what they planned to do with it. In the past, other Oscars have been auctioned off (or at least, auctions have been attempted).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that the statue bore Whoopi's name, it would've been tough to hand off, said Academy staff, but that doesn't mean some criminal didn't want it for other nefarious reasons.</p><p>Luckily, the statue made it home -- and Whoopi said she would never let it leave her house again.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-an-oscar-statue-worth>How Much Is An Oscar Statue Worth?</h2><p>Though much is made over celebrities receiving Oscars for their acting, the statues themselves aren't that expensive. They're made of bronze with gold plating, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which is arguably somewhat valuable at about $650</a>, says&nbsp;News10.</p><p>But as of 1951, actors who received Oscars weren't allowed to sell them. In fact, if Whoopi wanted to sell her statue, she could only sell it to the Academy -- and only for a single dollar.</p><p>That doesn't mean thieves wouldn't attempt to auction the statue, but it wouldn't be easy for them to cash out.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Whoopi Goldberg Is Writing A Superhero Movie About An Old Black Woman</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXay1sLvPomSgp5yZr6a%2Bxmaqraecmrtuu9KcmKtlo6mutcHEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-melissa-rauch-from-the-big-bang-theory.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Melissa Rauch From The Big Bang Theory?</span></a>
