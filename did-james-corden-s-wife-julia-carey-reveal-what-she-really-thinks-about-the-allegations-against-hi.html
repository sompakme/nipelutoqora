That makes people wonder <a href=#>what it's like to work with James Corden</a>.</p><p>Up until a little while ago, James Corden's family life seemed much less dramatic than his professional one. But that all changed with one restaurant meal that everyone started talking about. Here's what happened when James Corden was accused of being particularly mean and whether his wife Julia Carvey ever commented on the situation.</p><h2 id=what-are-the-allegations-against-james-corden>What Are The Allegations Against James Corden?</h2><p>In October 2022, Keith McNally, the owner of the beloved New York City restaurant Balthazar, announced that James Cordon had behaved poorly and that he would no longer be allowed to eat there. The restaurant is super famous and beloved for their brunch, which includes menu items like Moules Frites, Steak Frites, Eggs In Purgatory, Eggs Florentine, and a variety of pastries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Us Weekly, McNally wrote on Instagram, “James Corden is a Hugely gifted comedian, but a tiny Cretin of a man. And the most abusive customer to my Balthazar servers since the restaurant opened 25 years ago.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/james-corden-7.jpg><p>McNally shared two bad experiences, and one involved James Corden's wife Julia Carey. McNally said that the couple was upset because they modified an omelet and said that it came to their table completely wrong. McNally explained in his Instagram post, “The kitchen remade the dish but unfortunately sent it with home fries instead of salad. That’s when James Corden began yelling like crazy to the server: ‘You can’t do your job! You can’t do your job! Maybe I should go into the kitchen and cook the omelet myself!'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Are James Corden's Most Profitable Movies</a></span></p><p>A little while later, James Corden spoke to The New York Times and said of the situation, "I haven't done anything wrong, on any level. So why would I ever cancel this [interview]? I was there. I get it. I feel so Zen about the whole thing. Because I think it's so silly. I just think it's beneath all of us. It's beneath you. It's certainly beneath your publication."</p><h2 id=did-james-corden-39-s-wife-julia-carey-talk-about-the-scandal>Did James Corden's Wife Julia Carey Talk About The Scandal?</h2><p>It doesn't seem that James Corden's wife Julia Carey has talked about the allegations against her husband. According to him, she can't eat egg whites, and that is at the core of the issue here. While of course people understand not being able to eat something, it doesn't sound like Corden was as polite as he could have been at Balthazar's.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/james-corden-julia-carvey.jpg><p>Corden told The New York Times, "The reason I had to send the omelette back is because Jules is allergic to egg white. That's why we had ordered an egg yolk omelette."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Breaking Down James Corden's Net Worth Since Exiting The 'Late Late Show'</a></span></p><p>Corden shared that his wife was polite during the encounter. He said, "Her actual words were, 'But don't worry if you can't manage it.'"</p><p>James Corden's wife Julia Carey seems to have chosen to stay out of the public eye, and that seems to suit her. Several sources say that she once worked in TV production. According to The Sun, the couple has been together since 2009 and married since 2012.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar51524614-1.jpg><p>Of all the potential reasons why James Corden's wife Julia Carey didn't talk about the Balthazar scandal, the most likely one might be that she is used to her husband's fame. She might have accepted that people are going to say things about him and that it's best to stay out of it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why James Corden Cried After Hearing The Song Adele Wrote For Him</a></span></p><p>There's also the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Corden said he was sorry</a> about what happened. Julia Carey and James Corden might have talked about this beforehand and felt that this was the best way to handle it. According to NBC News, Corden said on The Late Late Show with James Corden that he "deeply regrets" his words. He also said, "I made a rude comment, and it was wrong. It was an unnecessary comment. It was ungracious to the server.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/did-james-corden-s-wife-julia-carey-reveal-what-she-really-thinks-about-the-allegations-against-him_.jpg><p>Of course, fans can only assume what Julia Carvey might be thinking since she hasn't given any interviews about the situation. Even though she is married to a famous comedian and actor who has a high net worth, Julia Carey seems to want to live a more regular life. She doesn't appear to talk to the press.</p><p>James Corden has only ever said sweet things about his wife, though, which suggests that they have a solid relationship. There is no indication that what happened at the NYC restaurant affected their marriage negatively and they are definitely still together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/james-corden-julia-carvey-daughter.jpg><p>According to People, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Corden talked about his wife</a> and shared what it was like when they met each other. They were both at a gathering for Save the Children and Corden's pal Dominic Cooper could tell that they would get along.</p><p>Corden said on The Jess Cagle Interview, “We sat and we very jokingly kind of planned the rest of our lives together, an hour and a half after we met. As a joke! We were just talking. And we were both talking about how much we felt like we were now past the notion of going out every night — that we had hit the age where the prospect of a quiet night in was glorious.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/james-corden-julia-carvey-1.jpg><p>Corden continued, “I remember saying to her, ‘Well, what about on Friday we could do nothing together? You could come over and we could just do nothing. And then maybe we could do nothing on the Saturday, and we could do nothing on the Sunday. And if our evenings are enough of nothing, then maybe this would be come something.' And she said, ‘That sounds like a fun idea.'"</p><p>Besides the allegations about James Corden's behavior at Balthazar's, James Corden and Julia Carvey's marriage has always seemed completely solid. They seem to be having fun raising their three children Charlotte, Carey, and Max.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYreiucSsZJynopmyr7%2BMsKCfnV2fwq21wGaamqqVrnq0rcidZJqan6rBbq3BrqqeZZGhuaazwK2gqKajZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carla-hall-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Carla Hall Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
