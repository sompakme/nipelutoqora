He flirted with me and invited me to walk along the golf course with him, which I did. During that time, he asked me for my phone number, which I gave to him. Later that evening, he invited me to his room. I said I didn’t feel right going alone, so two other women came with me.”</p><p>“In the penthouse suite, I met Donald again,” Drake continued. “When we entered the room, he grabbed each of us tightly in a hug and kissed each one of us without asking permission. He was wearing pajamas. A bodyguard was also present. He asked me about details on my job as an adult film star — about shooting porn, and he also asked us about our personal relationships and whether we were married or single. We answered his questions. It felt like an interview. About 30 or 45 minutes later, we left his room.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/gloria-allred-jessica-drake-c4ad33f3-5776-44f7-ae2f-610d4d81df54.jpg><p>Drake then says she returned to her bedroom when she received a call from a man asking for her on Trump’s behalf. “He said Donald wanted me to come back upstairs to Donald’s suite,” she explained. “I indicated I did not wish to return. Then Donald called. He asked me to return to his suite and have dinner with him. He also invited me to a party; I declined. Donald then asked me, ‘What do you want? How much?’ I told him that I couldn’t because I had to return to L.A. for work. I said that as an excuse because I didn’t want him to continue asking me, and I didn’t want to be with him. After that, I received another call from either Donald, or a male calling on his behalf, offering me $10,000. I declined again and once more gave, as an excuse, that I had to return to Los Angeles for work. I was then told Mr. Trump would allow me to use his private jet only if I accepted his private invitation.”</p><p>The actress continued, “I did relay my experiences immediately afterwards to some friends. Out of respect to the other parties involved and their families, I will not share their names, I am choosing to share my personal exchange in light of the recently released tapes in order to lend my voice, my strength and my support to the other women who are coming forward. Collectively, his words and his actions are a huge testament to his character, that of uncontrollable entitlement, misogyny and a sexual assault apologist. This is not acceptable behavior for anyone, much less a presidential candidate. I realize that in the situation I may be but a tiny grain of sand, but clearly this is an enormous speech. I am not looking for monetary compensation. I do not need additional fame or the type of attention that this is sure to bring. I understand that I may be called a liar or an opportunist, but I will risk that in order to stand in solidarity with women who share similar accounts that span many, many years.”</p><p>At the end of the press conference, Drake held up a photo of herself standing next to Trump at the 2006 golf tournament where they first met.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Drake with <a href=#>#DonaldTrump</a> at Tahoe event in 2006.

The picture is one of thousands taken out of respect for people asking to have their picture taken with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump does not know this person, does not remember this person and would have no interest in ever knowing her. This is just another attempt by the Clinton campaign to defame a candidate who just today is number one in three different polls. Anyone who would pay thugs to incite violence at a rally against American citizens, as was released on video, will stop at nothing. Just another example of the Clinton campaign trying to rig the election.”</p><p>Drake’s allegations come just two days after <a href=#>yoga instructor <b>Karena Virginia</b></a><b></b> became the 10th woman to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct. Virginia, who is also one of Allred’s clients, claimed the businessman grabbed her right arm and touched the inside of her breast during a 1998 encounter at the U.S. Open.</p><p>The 11 sexual misconduct allegations surfaced after a 2005 video of Trump <a href=#>bragging about groping women</a> was unearthed by <i>The Washington Post</i> earlier this month. In the days following, numerous alleged victims came forward with claims that they were inappropriately touched by the former <i>Celebrity Apprentice</i> host over the past 30 years.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Trump told his supporters during an appearance in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on Saturday morning that he <a href=#>plans to sue the women</a>, claiming that their stories are “total fabrication” and that “the events never happened.” He also denied the claims during the second and third 2016 presidential debates.</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnaOotqStjJ2pmqOVYq6kr9SsnKxllKS7orjDZqurrZ2lerCyjKycsa2RoXqutdKcpqecpZjBbsOTbW1rcWRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jaime-pressly-gives-birth-welcomes-twins-with-hamzi-hijazi.html><span>←</span><span>Jaime Pressly Gives Birth, Welcomes Twins With Hamzi Hijazi</span></a>
