I really miss these and thought they were such a great way to advance characters and storylines. Sure, they have tried it in recent years with Alexa Bliss, Chris Jericho, Dean Ambrose, Kevin Owens, and others—but it’s not the same. Back then, you had the set of the show set up in a certain section of the building. It wasn’t in the ring, which made it right away feel different, special, and unique. The obvious one that comes to mind is Piper’s Pit. Let’s think about all the cool storylines that came from that one.</p><p class=p1>The obvious first one is when Andre The Giant turned on Hulk Hogan. Who can ever forget that. It’s questionably the biggest storyline in the history of wrestling. Roddy Piper did such an amazing job helping Hogan and Andre tell their story. The “you’re bleeding” line to Hogan that Piper said help sell those 93,000 tickets. How about when Roddy Piper smashed the coconut over Jimmy Snuka’s head?! Talk about an iconic moment in the history of professional wrestling. There are just so many moments we could talk about and it would take over this and many other columns.</p><p class=p1>The Flower Shop was an interview segment featuring host <a href=#><span class=s1>“Adorable” Adrian Adonis</span></a>, which aired on the World Wrestling Federation’s syndicated program during the spring and summer of 1986. The program was a replacement of <a href=#><span class=s1>Piper’s Pit</span></a>, when Piper took a several-months hiatus from the WWF. My personal favorite storyline ever came from this segment.&nbsp;Paul Orndorff’s slow-building heel turn against his friend Hulk Hogan, with Adonis relentlessly needling Orndorff about living in Hogan’s shadow</p><p class=p1>Another great 80’s talk show segment was The Snake Pit with Jake “The Snake” Roberts. The Snake Pit was patterned after Piper’s Pit, wherein Roberts would conduct interviews with wrestlers or managers to help push wrestlers and get feuds over with the crowd. The segment was eventually moved to WWF Superstars of Wrestling as a replacement of “Piper’s Pit,” after another proposed replacement show – Missy’s Manor hosted by Missy Hyatt&nbsp; – was scrapped.</p><p class=p1>Who can forget The Barber Shop? It&nbsp;was an interview segment featuring host <a href=#><span class=s1>Brutus “the Barber” Beefcake</span></a>, which aired on the World Wrestling Federation’s syndicated <a href=#><span class=s2><i>WWF Wrestling Challenge</i></span></a><i> </i>from 1991-1992. The set was decorated like a barber shop, complete with chair, barber pole and plate glass window. The biggest storyline that came from here is when Shawn Michaels turned on Marty Jannetty! Talk about an iconic memory!</p><p class=p1>Before the birth of the WWF talk show segments, Vince McMahon Jr. would usually do the generic interviews himself in front of an empty ring and ask the wrestlers about an opponent or event. When Vince took over the family business, a part of his new programming included talk show style segments complete with a set. It was a weekly part of the show and something you would look forward to watching every week.</p><p class=p1>The Brother Love Show is another that was such a MAJOR part of 80’s WWF. It was hosted by the very popular podcast host Bruce Prichard. Prichard was dressed in a white suit and tie with a red shirt, with fingers full of gold jewelry — would berate face wrestlers (especially <a href=#><span class=s1>Hulk Hogan</span></a> and the <a href=#><span class=s1>Ultimate Warrior</span></a>) and openly support such heels as <a href=#><span class=s1>Ted DiBiase</span></a> and Bobby Heenan. In fact, DiBiase was Brother Love’s main “benefactor.” More than once, a wrestling feud was set up because of what occurred on “The Brother Love Show including Hulk Hogan’s feuds with Big Boss Man and Earthquake. Jake Roberts and Rick Martel’s classic angle was also shot on this show.</p><p class=p1>The Body Shop with Jesse “The Body” Ventura, The Funeral Parlor with Paul Bearer, The King’s Court, and The Heartbreak Hotel are other talk shows that took place during the golden era of wrestling.</p><p class=p1>What unbelievable memories that will last a lifetime came from all these talk shows we just spoke about. They were such a staple of our wrestling childhood. I wish they could bring it back and present it the way they did in the 80’s. How cool would that be? If not, we will always have these memories.</p><p class=p1><b>80’S WRESTLING CON:</b>&nbsp;80’s Wrestling Con takes place on Saturday, April 27th in Freehold, NJ at iPlay America.
