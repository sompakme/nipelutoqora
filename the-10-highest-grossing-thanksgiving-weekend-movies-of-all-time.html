In this list, we will evaluate every film that has been shown during a Thanksgiving weekend in order to determine which films earned the most money during their three-day holiday runs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before we delve into the statistics, it's important to note that we'll be evaluating all films that played on <a href=#>Thanksgiving</a> weekend, not simply those that debuted that weekend. So here are the top 10 highest-grossing Thanksgiving weekend movies of all time.</p><h2 id=the-hunger-games-mockingjay---part-2>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2</h2><p>Even though the end of the Hunger Games series premiered on November 20, 2015, its popularity was still robust by Thanksgiving. It earned $52 million at the box office during the three-day weekend. Katniss left District 13 in Mockingjay - Part 2 on a quest to assassinate President Snow at The Capitol. It was filled with dramatic action, rapidly rising stakes, and skilled acting. Despite the fact that not everyone agreed with the decision to divide the final book into two films, this film provided a satisfactory finale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-grinch>The Grinch</h2><p>Jim Carrey's live-action 2000s adaptation of The Grinch depicted the pompous green critter attempting to steal the holidays from Whoville. Despite receiving poor reviews, <a href=#>The Grinch</a> grossed $52 million during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. In 2018, a 3D computer-animated remake of The Grinch was released, however, it did not do as well over Thanksgiving weekend. However, it performed better at the box office altogether.</p><h2 id=harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire>Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the time Thanksgiving weekend rolled around, the fourth Harry Potter film was still being viewed by a large number of fans.

In addition to its stunning animation, critics praised the film's multilayered characters and interesting plot.</p><h2 id=the-hunger-games-mockingjay---part-1>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1</h2><p>Mockingjay: Part 1 established the stage for the final film's epic quest to the Capitol.
