The rapper came to prominence following the success of her first single, 'Super Bass', which had us all rapping along, however, it seems as if Nicki is making headlines more for her actions than her music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the rapper claiming to have retired from the industry, she seems to be ruffling a lot of feathers. Most recently, Minaj took to Twitter to reveal why <a href=#>she didn't attend this year's Met Gala</a>, claiming that they required all attendees to be fully vaccinated, and she is still doing her own research before receiving the vax.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Think Nicki Minaj's Fifth Album Is Nearing Close</a></span></p><p>This didn't sit well with Nicki, who has received loads of backlash in the past when it comes to supporting her <a href=#>sex offender husband, Kenneth Petty.</a> While the public attempted to understand Nicki's motives behind her stance on the vaccine, calling her out and trying to cancel her, it seems as if nothing can really take her down.</p><h2 id=nicki-minaj-expressed-anti-vax-sentiments>Nicki Minaj Expressed Anti-Vax Sentiments</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nicki Minaj is facing major backlash after she revealed that she has not yet received any form of vaccination to Covid-19. This all came about following a series of tweets Minaj posted to her social media platform when fans began to wonder why she wasn't in attendance at this year's Met Gala.</p><p>Well, turns out the esteemed event hosted by Anna Wintour, which Nicki has attended many times in the past, required celebs to be fully vaccinated, which Nicki is not. "They want you to get vaccinated for the Met. if I get vaccinated it won’t for the Met. It’ll be once I feel I’ve done enough research. I’m working on that now. In the meantime my loves, be safe. Wear the mask with 2 strings that grips your head & face. Not that loose one," Nicki wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were quick to call out the 'Super Bass' rapper, who made it clear she wants to do more research before determining whether or not she wants to get vaccinated. Considering there really is no amount of research that the ordinary person can do, that hasn't already been done by our top doctors, it seems as if Nicki also had another reason to not get vaxxed just yet.</p><p>Nicki claimed that she would also not be getting the vaccine at the moment as her brother's friend back home in Trinidad received the vax and is now "impotent". The CDC was quick to make it clear that the vaccine does not cause any infertility within men or women, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki ain't too sure about it</a>. Despite her outlandish comments, she's still in her right to be hesitant, however, no matter how hard fans try, Nicki won't get canceled over this, that's for sure!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Nicki Minaj Accepts Invitation To White House To Chat About COVID Vaccine</a></span></p><h2 id=she-39-s-supported-her-husband-amp-brother>She's Supported Her Husband & Brother</h2><p>Fans and the general public have been giving their $0.02 when it comes to Nicki's tweets, however, the rapper has been through far worse, so this won't tarnish her reputation one bit. Considering Nicki willingly married a sex offender, Kenneth Petty, and had kids with him.</p><p>This created a lot of controversies, however, Nicki's career remained intact and the rapper remained unbothered. Kenneth went on to make headlines this past month after it was revealed he'd <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">failed to register as a sex offender</a> upon his move from New York to California, which he pleaded guilty to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans later called out Nicki for financially supporting her brother, who is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">now serving 25 years to life in prison</a> for raping an 11-year-old girl. Considering the magnitude of both Kenneth and Nicki's brother, Jelani Minaj's actions, the public didn't hesitate to call her out, however, it managed to have absolutely no effect on her career either, making it clear that the vaccine controversy won't even create a scratch!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Nicki Minaj And Rihanna Fans React To Their Reunion</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmpaKbm556rrXNmqFmm5%2BquaV5zZ6tnqpdl7Jur8Cnmp6knJqxcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./here-s-why-andy-samberg-narrated-an-episode-of-mindy-kaling-s-never-have-i-ever.html><span>←</span><span>Here's Why Andy Samberg Narrated An Episode of Mindy Kaling's Never Have I Ever</span></a>
