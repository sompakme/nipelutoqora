He is agile, he is a stud man. That kid is as an&nbsp;athlete. He gets when he cuts a promo, you just get sucked in man. &nbsp;He&nbsp;is hypnotizing. When I talk to him like personal, on a personal level,&nbsp;he’s one of those kids who’s not afraid to learn, he has no ego. &nbsp;He’s&nbsp;still learning and he knows he’s still learning and he’s not afraid to&nbsp;ask questions, and I think that’s why he’s going to be so good. &nbsp;Cause&nbsp;he’s this good right now and he still wants to learn.”</p><p>On his MMA fight:</p><p>“I’d like to fight again. the first one didn’t go like I wanted it to&nbsp;I mean I hate to say that, at fourty-five years old, but I would. It’s&nbsp;just the first one, it was a great experience, especially leading up&nbsp;to the fight. The last week was as disappointing because we lost my&nbsp;opponent. &nbsp;Then for some reason I felt completely confident up until&nbsp;the point that they closed the cage. [Laughs] And then I was like,&nbsp;What the hell am I doing here? And I just kinda froze man and I froze&nbsp;long enough for Vince to get a couple really good shots on me that I&nbsp;mean just made me really dizzy. I was a little disappointed in myself&nbsp;because I didn’t think I was going to get nervous. &nbsp;I did, I totally&nbsp;froze.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgJVtbHBtXZeutbXSrZhmrJGhuLR51rCcZqqVqcKzuoyapZ1lnaS%2Fpg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./barry-diller-expedia-group-bio-age-wife-iac-net-worth-foundation-diane-von-f%C3%BCrstenberg-chil.html><span>←</span><span>Barry Diller Expedia Group, Bio, Age, Wife, IAC, Net worth, Foundation, Diane Von Frstenberg, Chil</span></a>
