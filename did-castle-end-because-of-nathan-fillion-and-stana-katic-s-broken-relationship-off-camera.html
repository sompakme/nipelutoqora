In fact, some believe that their issues ultimately brought an end to the show.</p><p>Let's take a look and see how truthful this is.</p><h2 id=why-did-39-castle-39-end>Why Did 'Castle' End?</h2><p>In March 2009, ABC debuted the crime mystery television series, Castle, which starred Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic. In no time at all, the show was able to find a loyal audience, and its fans played a huge part in its continued success on the small screen.</p><p>For 8 seasons and 173 episodes, Castle was one of the most popular shows on TV. ABC certainly had an interesting run during the 2010s, and Castle was easily one of its biggest and most popular shows.</p><p>The writing on the show was solid enough, but what really brought things to the next level was the chemistry between the two lead performers. Even the secondary players did an exceptional job in their roles, and everyone brought out the best of one another while the cameras were rolling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans genuinely could have watched this show for far longer than it ran on the small screen. However, as is the case with every show not named The Simpsons, this show reached an end back in 2016.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jon Stewart's Return To Television Might Have Unintentionally Started Beef With Trevor Noah</a></span></p><h2 id=39-castle-39-ended-and-speculation-began-of-tension>'Castle' Ended And Speculation Began Of Tension</h2><p>After 8 seasons, Castle came to an end. Fans were saddened to see the show disappear from TV screens, but few had any idea that even the actors were surprised about the show's cancellation.</p><p>Turns out, there were plans for a 9th season, but this never came to pass. Prior to production getting underway, it was announced that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stana Katic was not being brought back by the network</a>, which shocked many.</p><p>According to Katic, "I’m actually still not clear on the thought process behind the way that it went down. It hurt and it was a harsh ending.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I met so many beautiful people [on the show], and we collaborated on something really unique. It would be a disservice to those people, to the work that we did together, and to my work, which I feel contributed, in part, to the success of the show, to be anything but grateful," she added.</p><p>To this day, people are still genuinely confused by the move. However, over time, more details have emerged about what life was like on set. Unfortunately, the two leads of the show did not get along with one another.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kanye West's Beef With These Artists, Explained</a></span></p><h2 id=did-problems-cause-the-show-39-s-downfall>Did Problems Cause The Show's Downfall?</h2><p>So, did the friction between Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion lead to the show's downfall? Well, it is telling that Fillion was coming back, but Katic was not, and the reports of their feud paint an ugly picture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a source</a>, "Stana would go in her dressing room and cry. A lot of people who work on the show don't like Nathan. It's not just her. The friction was very evident. Nathan has been nasty to Stana for a long time. Stana was a pro, just wanted to get in there and do her job."</p><p>Another source revealed a detail that blew people away.</p><p>"This season, it got so out of hand they made Stana and Nathan go to couples counseling together."</p><p>Hearing something like this is quite surprising to fans, especially because these two had terrific chemistry on screen. That, however, is more of a testament to their acting albites, as opposed to how well they actually got along.</p><p>Before the show reached its finale, Fillion took to social media to praise Katic, who he had worked with for the last time.</p><p>"Stana has been my partner all this time, and I thank her for creating the character Beckett who will live on for all of us as one of the greatest police officers on television. I wish her well, and have no doubt she will succeed in everything she pursues. She will be missed," Fillion wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason 'SNL' Stars Mike Myers And Dana Carvey Ended Their Beef</a></span></p><p>Clearly, there were several factors at play, but there is no denying that the fracture between the two performers played a part in the show's ending.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Dave Chappelle Vs.
