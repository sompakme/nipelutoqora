I have a guest room and she stays in the guest room, and her sister also lives about a half an hour from me,” Christine <a href=#>told Us Weekly exclusively</a> earlier this month. “So she’ll see her and then she loves seeing Aspyn and Mykelti and the baby and all of it. So we’ve gone on a couple of trips together too.”</p><p>Christine <a href=#>announced her split</a> from Kody, 53, in November 2021. He remains spiritually married to Janelle and <strong><a href=#>Meri Brown</a></strong> and legally wed to <strong><a href=#>Robyn Brown</a></strong>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Logan and Michelle started dating in 2014 and got engaged in 2017. They waited until they were both finished school and saved some money before tying the knot.</p><p>Though Logan hasn’t been on Sister Wives since 2014, his parents excitedly told followers about the engagement in <a href=#>a 2017 video for TLC</a>. “I was pretty excited,” Janelle said at the time. “I was kind of getting worried because I’m pretty attached to Michelle. I was getting a little bit worried that Logan would let her slip away so I’m glad to see some commitment here.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kody added, “Logan and Michelle are a great match. Logan is sometimes high strung and Michelle knows to to calm down and get him to ease into it.”</p><p>More recently, his mom informed fans that he and Michelle finally moved into their forever home in July. “Celebrating Logan and Michelle’s new home today ! After months of delays they finally moved in. It’s an amazing space . Congratulations you guys ❤️,” she wrote via Instagram as they settled into their Las Vegas home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoaOpsrN51qKtnqtdn66vsculnGaZnpl6pLTRoqqtoZ6aeqLA056lnWWcpLSiutJmrp6clJ67qHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./raul-esparza-exits-law-order-svu-after-six-seasons.html><span>←</span><span>Raul Esparza Exits Law &amp;amp; Order: SVU After Six Seasons</span></a>
