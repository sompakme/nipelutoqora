Many fans of the MCU know that films are released in phases, and Phase 1 started with the debut of Iron Man<a href=#>starring Robert Downey Jr.</a> back in 2008. Since then, Marvel has released three more phases which has brought us (as of today) to a total of 25 movies and counting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Peggy Carter': Who Is Hayley Atwell's Boyfriend, And Are They Still Together?</a></span></p><p>With all these movies, several actors and actresses have been introduced to the forefront as beloved heroes.</p><p>Many of these superheroes have been with the franchise for over a decade. In spending so much time on set and likely forging bonds, one can only imagine that these people have enjoyed working for the industry giant. While this may be the natural assumption, let's find out what these actors who have left the MCU really think about working for Marvel.</p><h2 id=edward-norton---the-incredible-hulk><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Edward Norton - The Incredible Hulk</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When thinking of Bruce Banner, more likely than not, Mark Ruffalo is the actor you think of. <a href=#>Prior to Ruffalo playing the role</a> of Hulk in the first Avengers movie, however, Edward Norton was the green rage machine in The Incredible Hulk. Norton wasn’t happy with how his suggestions were handled, stating in a roast: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“You know what went wrong? I wanted a better script.” </a>Collaboration is key, and the original Hulk didn’t feel Marvel honored his ideas.</p><h2 id=dave-bautista---drax-the-destroyer><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Dave Bautista - Drax The Destroyer</span></h2><p>Beloved giant Drax, played by actor Dave Bautista, will only make an appearance in one more MCU film: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. While his time on set has been fun and he has enjoyed working alongside the cast, Bautista feels his career in Marvel has come to a natural end. Between the physical toll it's taken on his 52-year-old body and the storyline reaching an end, he is content in laying Drax to rest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Facts About Dave Bautista That Fans Choose To Ignore</a></span></p><h2 id=zachary-levi---fandral><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Zachary Levi - Fandral</span></h2><p>This character may be obscure, but superfans will recognize this Asgardian as one of Thor’s close friends. Josh Dallas was originally cast as this member of The Warriors Three but couldn’t commit to Thor: The Dark World. Because of this, Zachary Levi claimed the role under the assumption that he would be given decent screentime. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He shared at Dragon Con 2021 his disappointment in the screentime he received</a>, but says that overall, he still enjoyed his time working on the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hayley-atwell---peggy-carter><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Hayley Atwell - Peggy Carter</span></h2><p>Peggy Carter, played by <a href=#>British-American actress Hayley Atwell</a>, starred not only in the first Captain America film but also in the ABC television series Agent Carter. Once the series officially wrapped, Atwell felt more relief than anything else. Although happy to retire from Marvel, the female hero had no qualms with her director and coworkers, saying in an interview: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“I really like them, and I love the way ... they made me feel safe and also empowered.”</a></p><h2 id=clark-gregg---agent-coulson><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Clark Gregg - Agent Coulson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clark Gregg, also known as Agent Phil Coulson, has been part of the MCU for well over a decade. After leaving the MCU films, he remained a star on <a href=#>the show Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC</a>. Gregg loved his time with Marvel, saying in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his farewell message</a> for the show’s finale: “We built a family… [My character] gained, as I have, so much.” It’s a bittersweet goodbye as he closes the door to the MCU.</p><h2 id=hugo-weaving---red-skull><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Hugo Weaving - Red Skull</span></h2><p>Hugo Weaving, who plays one of the earliest villains in the MCU as Captain America’s enemy, <a href=#>was frustrated with Marvel after the movie</a>. He felt uncomfortable reprising his role, sharing: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“…[Marvel] pushed back on the contracts that we agreed on and so the money they offered me for ‘The Avengers’ was much less than I got for the very first one...</a> And the promise when we first signed the contracts was that the money would grow each time.” He was replaced by Ross Marquand for Infinity War and Endgame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=terrence-howard---rhodey-war-machine><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Terrence Howard - Rhodey/War Machine</span></h2><p>Fans that have been with Marvel since the beginning know that Rhodey was quickly recast after the first movie, moving from <a href=#>Terrence Howard to Don Cheadle</a>. All sorts of rumors have spread about Howard’s grievance with the company, and after a decade of leaving us wondering, he shared his stance during an interview with Andy Cohen: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“Am I going to come back and be War Machine? They could have a huge franchise off of it, but f*** ‘em.”</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Terrible Way Terrence Howard Followed In His Father's Footsteps</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-evans---captain-america><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Chris Evans - Captain America</span></h2><p>America’s Boy Scout, beloved by many, Steve Rodgers was written off by choosing life with his love over the shield at the end of ‘Avengers: Endgame.’ After being part of the MCU for almost 10 years, Chris Evans was ready to retire the hero lifestyle and peacefully transition out of the franchise. Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">director Kevin Feige firmly stated Evans won’t reprise his role</a>, there are no hard feelings between the actor and the franchise.</p><h2 id=scarlett-johansson---black-widow><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Scarlett Johansson - Black Widow</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Scarlett-Johansson-Black-Widow.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Phase 1 superhero and first female Avenger officially left the MCU earlier this year after her last film, Black Widow, released both in theaters and through the Disney+ streaming services. Scarlett Johansson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hit Marvel with a lawsuit</a> because, as a common trend, the company drastically <a href=#>slashed her pay</a> despite their existing contract. Despite this upsetting event, Johansson was satisfied with her time on set and is happy to step aside to make way for new beginnings.</p><h2 id=robert-downey-jr---iron-man><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Robert Downey Jr. - Iron Man</span></h2><p>Robert Downey Jr., the debut superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, has been the <a href=#>center of numerous rumors</a> over the last 11 years regarding the franchise. Regardless of what’s been said, the actor who brought Iron Man/Tony Stark to life has nothing but love for Marvel. He shared that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> it was among the greatest joys to play the iconic hero</a>, and left the company with a happy heart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Much Does The MCU Spend On Its Biggest Shows?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYq6kwM6rqmavmKR6qa3VnmSlnZaperW0xGaknK1dp7KiuMuyZK2gmaO4bq3BqKytZaekv6y1zaBkn6eiYrqivtWeo2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shop-the-13-best-push-up-swimsuits-for-a-built-in-boost.html><span>←</span><span>Shop the 13 Best Push-Up Swimsuits for a Built-In Boost</span></a>
