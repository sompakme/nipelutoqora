Prior to this internet boom, however, celebrities had to find jobs like the rest of us. Some worked in retail, others worked in the service industry, while others chose to apply at fast food restaurants.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Madonna is just one of the many </a>who got their start in food franchises.</p><h2 id=gwen-stefani-was-an-ice-cream-scooper-at-dairy-queen><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Gwen Stefani Was An Ice Cream Scooper At Dairy Queen</span></h2><p>Gwen Stefani is a jack of all trades. Although her claim to fame was <a href=#>performing with her band No Doubt in the 90s</a>, she now not only continues to sing, rap, and write songs but has added acting and fashion design to her resume. Before all this, however, she was an employee at The Dairy Queen, scooping ice cream and serving blizzards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=p-nk-worked-at-many-fast-food-chains><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>P!nk Worked At Many Fast Food Chains</span></h2><p>The American singer and songwriter P!nk has been releasing music since the year 2000. Although she released many albums throughout the 2000s, she took a step back to focus on family for a few years before <a href=#>rejoining the charts in 2017</a>. Prior to her fame, she had jobs at many fast food chains, including Pizza Hut, McDonald’s, and Wendy’s… the last of which she lasted less than a day before quitting.</p><h2 id=burger-king-used-to-employ-queen-latifah><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Burger King Used To Employ Queen Latifah</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When she was only fifteen years old, Queen Latifah was hired for the night shift at Burger King. Although she enjoyed the job, she went on to become the <a href=#>rapper, singer, and actress that fans know and love</a>. She was signed and released her debut album in 1989, then skyrocketed to fame with several record deals and later becoming an accomplished actress.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Dana Elaine Owens Goes By Queen Latifah</a></span></p><h2 id=madonna-was-fired-from-her-dunkin-39-donuts-job><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Madonna Was Fired From Her Dunkin' Donuts Job</span></h2><p>Before becoming the one-name wonder we know as <a href=#><strong>Madonna</strong></a>, this singer, songwriter, and actress was employed at Dunkin' Donuts. Perhaps not a surprise to her fans, Madonna caused quite a riot at the donut shop before she was fired. To keep things interesting, she would reportedly squirt jelly from the pastries onto customers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-hudson-also-worked-at-burger-king-before-fame><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jennifer Hudson Also Worked At Burger King Before Fame</span></h2><p>Jennifer Hudson’s <a href=#>rise of recognition came from American Idol</a>, but she now stands firmly on her own two legs as a singer and actress. One of her early jobs was working at Burger King, the same location her sister worked at. The two rang up orders and prepared food side by side before moving on to bigger and better dreams.</p><h2 id=seal-hated-his-time-at-mcdonald-39-s><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Seal Hated His Time At McDonald's</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>British singer and songwriter Seal, who was also known for <a href=#>his marriage to model Heidi Klum</a>, has been in the public eye for decades. He first started touring in the 80s with a British funk band and released his most recent album in 2017, even competing on The Masked Singer. Before all this, he was a McDonald’s employee, though he hated every moment and quit after just two weeks.</p><h2 id=country-singer-shania-twain-thanks-mcdonald-39-s-for-her-fame><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Country Singer Shania Twain Thanks McDonald's For Her Fame</span></h2><p><a href=#>Shania Twain has sold over 100 million records</a> during her career thus far, which has helped raise her to become the best-selling woman in country music.

She was fired after following a couple into the parking lot after they took her pen and flipping them off.</p><h2 id=pharrell-williams-was-fired-from-mcdonald-39-s-3-times><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Pharrell Williams Was Fired From McDonald's 3 Times</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Believe it or not, Pharrell Williams has been fired from McDonald’s three times. Before becoming a rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, and entrepreneur, he did what most teenagers do: he applied for a job at McDonald’s. He worked at and was fired from three different locations thanks to his laziness and love for eating chicken nuggets while on the job.</p><h2 id=fred-durst-was-a-mcdonald-39-s-employee-in-the-39-80s><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Fred Durst Was A McDonald's Employee In The '80s</span></h2><p>Joining the rank of McDonald’s employees is Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit.
