She has proven herself in one of the most-watched Netflix series called Shtisel.</p><h2 id=who-is-sabra-in-the-marvel-universe>Who Is Sabra In The Marvel Universe?</h2><p>Sabra’s character was introduced in the early 1980s in an issue of The Incredible Hulk. She was written by the writer, Bill Mantlo and drawn by the artist, Sal Buscema. The character is created with several superpowers such as super-strength, speed, agility, and stamina.</p><p>In the Marvel Comics written by Stan Lee, the character Sabra is a Jewish heroine and former Mossad agent, also known as Ruth Bat Seraph.

The Palestinian refugee camp where the 1982 Sabra and Shatila Massacre took place was called Sabra. This massacre involved the killing of over 3,500 civilians — mostly Palestinians — who were forced to leave the country due totheir conflict with Israel.</p><p>The announcement of the introduction of the character has caused quite a stir among netizens since the first day. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They have expressed their criticism</a> on various platforms, the most predominant of them being Twitter.</p><p>One fan wrote, “The first thing pretty much every Palestinian remembers when we read or hear Sabra, is the massacre of Sabra Shatilla, it feels deliberate.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Something I never thought I'd tweet, but Marvel calling an Israeli superhero 'Sabra' is because Jews born in the region have been referred to as 'Sabras' (a local fruit, prickly on the outside, soft on the inside) since the 30s. It's not referencing the Sabra & Shatila massacre," another Twitter user defended Marvel.</p><h2 id=is-the-appearance-of-the-character-confirmed>Is The Appearance Of the Character Confirmed</h2><p>Due to the huge controversy and disagreement about featuring the Israeli superhero character, it is not guaranteed that the character Sabra will be featured in Captain America: New World Order.</p><p><a href=#>Fans were against Megan Thee Stallion joining Marvel as She-Hulk.</a> Much to their relief, the deal did not go through, but that did not stop the director of the series from having the singer on-board for a cameo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar51968649-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there is a part of the MCU fandom that approves of Sabra’s character, the other part wants to have it eliminated from the upcoming movie.
