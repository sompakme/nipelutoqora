The garment, which the Princess Diaries star teamed with black leather gloves, is inspired by the Atelier Versace collection that debuted in the spring of 1995. In a different photo, Hathaway showed off her legs in a sparkly black mini dress, sheer tights and glossy pointed-toe pumps.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The New York native also showed off a sculpted bustier corset that was styled with fitted jeans and a chunky gold belt. Of the capsule, Hathaway gushed in the Monday press release: “To me, the Versace Icons collection is timeless elegance with an edge. I’m so proud of these images, which seem to represent <a href=#><strong>Donatella Versace</strong></a>’s vision of empowerment.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She continued: “What has left the biggest impression on me from this amazing experience is Donatella’s heart, generosity and kindness. She and everyone in the Versace family have been so incredibly welcoming and supportive of me, for which I am very grateful. What a thrill to be a Versace woman!”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Donatella also raved over the designs. “I will wear every piece in this collection and have worn similar for decades,” she said. “These luxury wardrobe essentials fit perfectly and showcase the beautiful and powerful simplicity of our silhouette. The multi-faceted and inspirational women we dress, talk about how Versace make the feel: considered, confident and stunning. Just as an Icon should feel.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Hathaway’s involvement in the Icons campaign comes amid her undeniable fashion comeback. Over the last year, the <a href=#>Devil Wears Prada</a> star has blessed Us with breathtaking fashion moments. Most recently, Hathaway commanded attention at <a href=#>Versace’s fall/winter runway show</a> in Los Angeles. For the March 9 presentation, she wowed in a crocodile-embossed mini dress teamed with towering platform boots.&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Her stylish reign was recognized in <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>’s 25 Most <a href=#>Powerful Stylist</a> issue, which featured Hathaway and her stylist, <strong>Erin Walsh</strong>, on the cover.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Hustle star praised Walsh to THR, telling the publication in its Tuesday, March 28, story: “Erin sees my idiosyncrasies as a strength … Maybe there was initial confusion with me because I was introduced to the world as a teenaged princess, but I never actually connected to things that are ‘sweet’ and ‘pretty’ — no shade at all for those wonderful options. I love the right risk.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Hathaway and Walsh — who also dresses <a href=#><strong>Lucy Hale</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ashley Park</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Elizabeth Banks</strong></a> — began working with each other in the fall of 2019, and have created red carpet magic ever since.</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Keep scrolling to see Hathaway pose in Versace’s Icons campaign:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvAp6WeZZiWwamt1pqwZquklr%2B0ecinZKedp2LDpr7SmpqeZZmYvK%2B%2FjJyYpqiRnrSvec%2Bhpq2no2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./26-surprising-things-that-happened-behind-the-scenes-of-star-wars.html><span>←</span><span>26 Surprising Things That Happened Behind The Scenes Of Star Wars</span></a>
