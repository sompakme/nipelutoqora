So here I am with mine out and about and proud.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ashley-Graham-swimsuitsforall-stretch-marks.jpg><p>The Nebraska native, who <a href=#>welcomed son Isaac</a> in January, revealed that she had to come to terms with her new physique after giving birth. “It looks so simple and beautiful but powerful. I’ve got more weight on me. I have stretch marks, and in the beginning, I really had to have a lot of conversations with myself and tell myself, ‘OK, new body, new mindset,’” she recalled. “But after this photo shoot, I felt so empowered because I was like, ‘Yes. I look good. I feel good. This is my new mom bod.’”</p><p>Graham divulged more details about the campaign on her Instagram account. “Some things I love: a cute bathing suit and a backyard shoot with the family!” she wrote on Wednesday. “We’ve had such [a] great time making the most of this summer in Nebraska and these suits have me feeling great for my first summer as a mommy!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this month, the&nbsp;American Beauty Star&nbsp;host shared intimate photos of <a href=#>her son breast-feeding</a>. She captioned the Saturday, July 25, post, “After pool chilaxin.”</p><p>Graham and Ervin, 31, previously <a href=#>teamed up for her&nbsp;Harper’s Bazaar UK&nbsp;July 2020 cover shoot</a>. She modeled for the filmmaker as her other family members pitched in to help while quarantined together at their Nebraska farm during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaaq5ihsrp5xquYoZmdYr%2BmwsSao6xlp53Gbr%2FHnmSknaCperTA0Z6rnKBdoq6zt9JmoKdlkp64qrrIZqeim6Nk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andy-cohen-jokes-he-deserves-meme-treatment-for-dressing-like-nsync.html><span>←</span><span>Andy Cohen Jokes He Deserves Meme Treatment for Dressing Like 'NSync</span></a>
