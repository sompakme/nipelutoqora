They’re awesome.”</p><p>Nearly two weeks ago, Lowe attended the Kansas City Chiefs versus Denver Broncos game wearing a <a href=# rel=noopener>“Where’s Taylor?” hat</a>. (Swift herself also made an appearance at the event as she was<a href=#> spotted chatting</a> with Travis’ dad, <a href=#><strong>Ed Kelce</strong></a>.)</p><p>Travis, 34, and Swift have been making headlines over the past couple of months for their budding romance. After the athlete invited her to see him “rock the stage” at Arrowhead stadium, she showed up to watch the <a href=#>Chiefs defeat the Chicago Bears</a> in September.</p><p>Swift has continued to show up at Travis’ games since, with a source exclusively telling Us Weekly earlier this month that their relationship is <a href=#>“going great.”</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rob-Lowe-Thinks-Taylor-Swift-and-Travis-Kelces-Romance-is-Good-for-the-NFL-2.jpg><p>“It’s still so new, but they really like each other,” the insider shared. “They both want to see each other when they can and they’re both understanding of each other’s schedules. They’re supportive of each other and they don’t have to be by each other’s side all the time and that feels comfortable. They plan to carve out moments to spend together to get to know each other better.”</p><p>After Swift cheering Travis on from a distance, the couple made their first public appearance after their<a href=#> Saturday Night Live&nbsp;</a>cameos on October 14. The twosome were <a href=#>spotted holding hands</a> in New York City and attended an SNL afterparty together.</p><p>After their date night, another insider told Us that Travis is “<a href=#>different from anybody Taylor has dated before</a>” and she keeps “falling for him more and more as the days go by.”</p><p>“He goes out of his way to make Taylor feel special in any way he can … Taylor couldn’t believe the massive bouquet of flowers Travis sent to her just because,” the source continued. “He supports her independence and success.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A third insider shared that friends think Swift and Kelce were<a href=#> “in love.”</a></p><p>“They’re really happy. They’re not saying they’re in love yet. But it’s obvious to her friends they’re heading in that direction,” a source explained to Us on Friday, October 20. “Friends think they’re in love. He’s going to see her when she’s back on tour. That’s already planned. And when she gets a break, she’ll see him. It’s going so well because it’s easy and nothing is complicated.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp5JiubDDxGaqrqigpL%2B1v4ytmLKkn6d6tMPIn6tmrKKWw6q%2FjKScpZuVYr%2BwucCnmp5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mandy-rose-on-tough-enough-her-wrestling-background-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Mandy Rose On Tough Enough, Her Wrestling Background And More</span></a>
