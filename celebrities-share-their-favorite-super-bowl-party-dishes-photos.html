While the game might be the main draw for some, others care more about the delicious food.</p><p>Ahead of Super Bowl LVII, Food Network icon <a href=#><strong>Guy Fieri</strong></a> exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in January 2023 that he opts for a “real eclectic menu” come the big game. “I want the ability to eat a lot [or] to eat a little. I want the ability to have all different types of flavors,” he explained.</p><p>The Guy’s Grocery Games star added: “I’ll have a cold cut section, a meatball section, some chicken tenders and some sauces and [a] cheese section, but the key is to make the baseline foundation. And the bread is probably one of the things that gets the most like, ‘Oh yeah, get some bread.’ No, get some King’s Hawaiian [bread] do this the right way.”</p><p>Celebrity chef <strong>Sunny Anderson</strong>, for her part, opts for<a href=#> a Thanksgiving-like spread</a>. “If I’m couch–gating on Super Bowl Sunday, I plan it like Thanksgiving with all the typical foods [as well as] a few new things I want to try,” she exclusively told Us in January 2023.</p><p>When Us&nbsp;spoke to Queer Eye star <a href=#><strong>Antoni Porowski</strong></a> in January 2020, for example, the Canadian cutie joked that he had “all the plans for the sports game activity going on.” Translation: Food is his chief concern.</p><p>“Honestly, I think of snacks,” he dished, noting that he loves “a pig in a blanket” with a “good” Dijon. “I want to have a nice Dijon with a little bit of honey and, like, way too many pigs in blanket,” he said. “Then when I get full, [I can] remove the croissant crust and just eat the pigs.”</p><p>Former New England Patriots star <strong>Rob Gronkowski</strong> is used to playing in the Super Bowl, but this year he’s headed down to Miami to host a bash called <a href=#>Gronk Beach Party</a> on Saturday, February 1. While watching the game the following day, there’s one food in particular he’ll be looking out for. “I love dips,” he told Us exclusively earlier this month. “If I’m at a Super Bowl party, I need to get some dips.”</p><p>For Lip Sync Battle cohost <a href=#><strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong></a>, picking just one must-have Super Bowl party dish is basically an impossible task. That’s why the star shared several of her most beloved creations via her Cravings website in January 2020. One of her top game day choices is an “epic” pizza dip.</p><p>“Imagine if you took a piping-hot delivery pepperoni pizza and slid it off its crust into a skillet, kept it warm and gooey, then served it with crunchy garlicky bread toasts,” she mused in the recipe description. “That’s basically what this pizza dip is and it’s epic.” The star is also a fan of her tasty take on baked “fried” pickles.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Believe it or not, while <a href=#><strong>Martha Stewart</strong></a> has a plethora of drool-worthy Super Bowl recipes in her arsenal, she <a href=#>won’t be firing up her stove at all this year</a>. “I go to the Super Bowl, so you have to do what they do at the Super Bowl,” she told Us in 2020.&nbsp;“We have all our reservations already made.”</p><p>To see what more stars will be snacking on come Super Bowl Sunday, scroll down!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyxtcKtrKudo2SwprjEm6mirJmawG6%2Fx5qpnmWknbKqvoyfmK%2Bnop7BpnnSrqeeql2XvLi4jKmYq6ypYrGqv8eeqmaomKTBsL%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bruce-buffer-net-worth-how-much-is-bruce-buffer-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Bruce Buffer Net Worth How Much Is Bruce Buffer Worth?</span></a>
