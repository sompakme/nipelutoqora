As a child, I used to wake my parents up at 7 a.m. by blasting <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a> on their stereo. My mother and father were always worried I’d break the needle on the turntable.</p><p>3. During a local fair in my hometown, I [got a job running] a game booth. I was so sad when someone would walk away empty-handed, I gave a prize to everyone who played. I was fired halfway through the day.</p><p>4. I was one of the five members of the boy band Dream Street.</p><p>5. I’m a very well-practiced dart player.</p><p>6. My favorite poet is Shel Silverstein.</p><p>7. My lucky number is seven.</p><p>8. I’m not ashamed to admit that I regularly get a manicure and pedicure.</p><p>9. Smoking meat is one of my favorite weekend hobbies.</p><p>10. I sing Christmas songs in the shower all year long.</p><p>11. I put Parmesan cheese and banana peppers on my popcorn.

I bought it with my own money at 16 years old.</p><p>14. My fiancée, <a href=#><strong>Katie [Peterson]</strong></a>, and I love to play couples golf. She has a beautiful swing. I do not.</p><p>15. When I’m overwhelmed, I like to go on long drives by myself to clear my head.</p><p>16 I just learned how to play backgammon.</p><p>17. I collect wristwatches.</p><p>18. When people come up to me, they tell me I look like <a href=#><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></a>, <strong><a href=#>Frankie Muniz</a></strong> or Jesse McCartney.</p><p>19. I still have dreams of winning a Grammy, an Emmy, an Oscar and a Tony. I’ve been nominated for two [Daytime Emmys], but never won.</p><p>20. I’ve been to every state in the country except Alaska.</p><p>21. I’m told I often laugh in my sleep.</p><p>22. My go-to fast food is the Double-Double, Animal-Style burger from In-N-Out.</p><p>23.
