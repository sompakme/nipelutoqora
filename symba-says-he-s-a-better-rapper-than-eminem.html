In 2022, <a href=# id=auto-tag_the-game data-tag=the-game>The Game</a> dissed the 50-year-old on multiple occasions, including on the song <a href=#>“The Black Slim Shady” </a>from his Drillmatic – Heart vs. Mind album. During an appearance on Drink Champs, the Compton native invited Em to join him on a track to determine who’s the more skilled emcee.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“When y’all say Eminem is better and all that, I see it, I see it. I feel you,” The Game said at the time. “And you know what? If you feel like Eminem is better than me, that’s your opinion. But it’s a lot of people that feel like I’m better than Eminem, and that’s they opinion.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Me personally? Is Eminem better than me? Nah, he not, bro. And I think the best way to see if he is or if I am is let’s rap about it. Let’s get up. Let’s get in the studio. Let’s rap about it. Let’s do something. Let’s put something out. Let’s see ’cause that’s what this sh*t is, bro. It’s rap.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Eminem has since responded to his critics on the song “Realest” by his latest signee, rapper Ez Mil.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6jGrq7AZpmerKSav26%2BwKmnnqpdmrqqusSmZGpqY2mEeoCYb2do</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeremy-mayfield-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Jeremy Mayfield Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
