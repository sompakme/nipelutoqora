I was 21, he was 16,” Azaria, 59, who guest starred on Perry’s hit sitcom <a href=#>Friends</a>, said via an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram video</a> on Sunday, October 29. “Matthew and I became really good friends and we were really more like brothers for a long time. We drank a lot together, we laughed a lot together, we were there for each other in the early days of our career.”</p><p>Perry <a href=#>died from an apparent drowning</a> on Saturday, October 28, at age 54. Police responded to a call of someone in cardiac arrest at a Los Angeles home, where they reportedly <a href=#>found Perry unconscious in a hot tub</a>. The authorities said there was no sign of foul play but <a href=#>an investigation into Perry’s death is still ongoing.</a></p><p>In his social media post, Azaria reflected on Perry’s struggles, which <a href=#>stemmed from his addiction to drugs and alcohol</a>. Perry candidly discussed how his life took a turn following a jet ski accident in 1997. He became addicted to Vicodin, which led to alcohol abuse as well. In 2000, Perry was hospitalized with pancreatitis and ultimately <a href=#>started detoxing while still filming Friends.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Matthew-Perry-Brought-Friends-Costar-Hank-Azaria-to-His-1st-AA-Meeting-He-Helped-Me-Get-Sober2.jpg><p>“I really loved him. A lot of us who were close to him felt like we lost him to drugs and alcohol a long time ago because — as he documented in his autobiography — there was so much suffering,” Azaria noted of Perry’s <a href=#>2022 memoir, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</a>. “I had to pick up and put down that biography, like, 11 times. It was so painful for me to read.”</p><p>Perry detailed his multiple attempts to get sober over the years in his book. On his road to recovery, Perry was inspired to open a sober living home for men in 2013. He later discussed <a href=#>his commitment to helping others face their addiction.</a></p><p>“I would like to be remembered as somebody who lived well, loved well, was a seeker,” Perry said on the “Q With Tom Power” podcast in 2022. “And his paramount thing is that he wants to help people. That’s what I want.”</p><p>He added: “The best thing about me, bar none, is that if somebody comes to me and says, ‘I can’t stop drinking, can you help me?’ I can say ‘yes’ and follow up and do it. When I die, I don’t want Friends to be the first thing that’s mentioned. I want that to be the first thing that’s mentioned. And I’m gonna live the rest of my life proving that.”</p><p>While reminiscing on his friendship with Perry, Azaria said the late actor helped him get clean.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m a sober guy for 17 years, and I wanna say that, the night I went into AA [Alcoholics Anonymous], Matthew brought me in,” he added on Sunday. “The whole first year I was sober, we went to meetings together. He was so caring and giving. He totally helped me get sober. And I really wish he could’ve found it in himself to stay with the silver life more consistently.”</p><p>Azaria concluded the heartbreaking video <a href=#>by celebrating Perry’s legacy</a>, saying, “Most nights you spent with Matthew you were crying laughing by the end. As an actor, he was so brilliant. I just wish we could have gotten what the rest of his career would’ve been.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaSptabDjKmcq6qpYrWmuM%2Bem2agkaO4bq3ZmqmimV2csrV50qiZnqpdl8ZurtGipaChnpx6qbXMZquoZZGWfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leon-rose-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Leon Rose Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
