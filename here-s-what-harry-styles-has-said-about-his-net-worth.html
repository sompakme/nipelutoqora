The band consisted of Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson, and Harry Styles.</p><p>After the show, One Direction became a pop sensation that took the world by storm with catchy songs such as "Best Song Ever," "You Don't Know You're Beautiful" and "Story of my Life."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did you Know Harry Styles Wrote This Hit Song For Ariana Grande?</a></span></p><p>After 5 studio albums, worldwide sell-out tours, and being one of the most successful artists to come out of The X Factor to this day, One Direction went their separate ways and each became a solo artist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Does Harry Styles Wear So Many Rings?</a></span></p><p>Harry Styles has become the most successful of the boys, a critically acclaimed artist who released his debut single "Sign of the Times" in 2017. "Water Melon Sugar," released in 2019, was his first no. 1 single, but 2019 became the year Harry got recognition and was taken seriously as a solo artist, being nominated for 3 Grammy Awards.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-is-also-an-actor-with-earning-potential>Harry Styles Is Also An Actor With Earning Potential</h2><p>Beyond his exceptional achievements throughout his music career, acting can also be added to his impressive repertoire. In 2017, Harry Styles made his acting debut in the World War II film Dunkirk, and will be in the <a href=#>upcoming adaptation of the successful novel My Policeman</a>.</p><p>Harry Styles has amassed an impressive <a href=#>net worth of $80 million</a>. So what does the artist say about his wealth?</p><h2 id=harry-39-s-spoken-up-about-fame-and-his-career>Harry's Spoken Up About Fame And His Career</h2><p>Throughout his career, what's mattered to Harry Styles is being his true authentic self. In an interview with Rolling Stone, <a href=#>Harry spoke about the tour for his debut solo album</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The tour, that affected me deeply. It really changed me emotionally. Having people come to sing the songs. For me the tour was the biggest thing in terms of being more accepting of myself, I think. I kept thinking, "Oh wow, they really want me to be myself. And be out and do it."</p><p>It seems that the money doesn't matter so much to Harry. A lot of his wealth is spent helping charities.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry has donated millions to 62 charities</a>, including Help Refugees, We Love Manchester, Save the Children, and Born This Way Foundation, to name a few. He has also donated proceeds from his Treat People with Kindness merchandise to charity too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Harry Styles Was The Only One Chloé Zhao Wanted As Eros In ‘Eternals’</a></span></p><p>Of course, Harry also spends some of that hard-earned cash on himself. He has impressive real estate, owning three houses on the same London street.</p><p>His third home in Hampstead cost $5.5 million, and all three Hampstead properties are neighbors to a few big stars, including Emma Thompson, Helena Boham Carter and Ricky Gervais.</p><p>Another thing Harry spends his money on his collecting cars. Harry loves his supercars and vintage automobiles and has been collecting them for years.</p><p>This comes as no surprise since it's clear that Harry also has a love of vintage fashion too, <a href=#>something he's had a love of since childhood</a>. The singer also has a clothing archive vault with 24-hour surveillance, where his stunning gender-fluid outfits are stored.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Harry Styles Recently Helped A Fan Come Out To Her Mom</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harry Styles spends his wealth on fashion, cars, houses and gives to charity, but money isn't the driving force when it comes to decisions about career moves and upcoming projects.</p><p>For example, he wanted <a href=#>nothing to do with the live-action adaptation of The Little Mermaid</a>, a Disney movie that could have made him an even bigger star, because it would interfere with touring.</p><h2 id=harry-has-turned-down-lucrative-opportunities>Harry Has Turned Down Lucrative Opportunities</h2><p>'I had a meeting with Rob Marshall, the director, who is the most wonderful man — he’s great,' said Harry.
