Their home was also littered with household help, which at a cost of $84,040.78 a year, ensured that their daily lives were effortless and comfortable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What The Cast Of Yellowstone Really Thinks Of Kevin Costne</a></span></p><p>The twosome also spared no expense when it came to gifts, showering themselves with lavish presents amounting to a jaw-dropping $830,504.51 in 2022 alone.</p><p>As if living like royalty in their sprawling mansions was not enough, Costner and Baumgartner also relished in the luxuries offered by prestigious Beach Clubs, which came with an annual price tag of $288,381.24. The duo also enjoyed golfing at exclusive clubs, with membership dues amounting to $34,434.90.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Of Kevin Costner’s Staggering $250 Million Net Worth Actually Comes From His Beloved Role On Yellowstone?</a></span></p><p>For their recreational escapades, the couple owned a luxurious boat, which incurred yearly expenses amounting to a whopping $25,806.45. The two also dedicated a staggering $21,807.67 to what was presumably a very comprehensive spa service. In addition, to maintain a physique worthy of their A-list status, the twosome deployed the services of a personal trainer, which set them back a staggering $12,851.58 in 2022 alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christine-baumgartner-spent-quite-a-bit-of-kevin-costner-rsquo-s-net-worth>Christine Baumgartner Spent Quite A Bit Of Kevin Costner’s Net Worth</h2><p>Kevin Costner's ex-wife, Christine, is no stranger to the finer things in life, and with access to Costner’s eye-watering net worth, the mother of three quickly got accustomed to living a life befitting royalty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/this-is-why-yellowstone-has-been-called-_the-nepo-babies-show_.jpg><p>According to court documents obtained by PageSix, the 49-year-old jet-setted across the world on a regular basis, spending quite a bit on high-end hotels and private residences.</p><p>Baumgartner was also quite fond of cosmetic procedures, investing over $180,000 in various procedures to maintain her youthful allure. The 49-year-old also had a taste for exquisite fashion, sparing no expense to ensure that her wardrobe was a true reflection of her affluent status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Court documents also revealed her penchant for convenience and ease, evident in the staggering $222,586 charged to her AMEX credit card in 2022 alone. The mother of three also made numerous ATM withdrawals, allowing her to have cash on hand for impulsive purchases or spontaneous adventures.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything To Know About Sandra Bullock's Super Close Friendship With Kevin Costner's Ex-Wife Christine Baumgartner</a></span></p><p>Baumgartner's financial endeavors extended beyond personal indulgences. The 49-year-old also took on construction loans, presumably for her own property projects. Attorney fees also featured in her expenditure, suggesting involvement in legal matters befitting her affluent status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=can-christine-baumgartner-support-her-lifestyle-without-kevin-costner>Can Christine Baumgartner Support Her Lifestyle Without Kevin Costner?</h2><p>Christine Baumgartner is an avid entrepreneur, having co-founded the renowned Cat Bag Couture handbag line, and launched her own luxury handbag collection. The 49-year-old's net worth is currently estimated to be an impressive $7 million. However, despite her successful entrepreneurial ventures, the former model has admitted to being incapable of supporting the kind of lifestyle her kids had gotten accustomed to during her 18-year marriage to Kevin Costner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/everything-to-know-about-sandra-bullock-s-super-close-friendship-with-kevin-costner-s-wife-christine-baumgartner-1.jpg><p>Baumgartner reportedly has no income of her own, having chosen to be a stay-at-home mom since the birth of her eldest child. The 49-year-old is, therefore, demanding child support payment amounting to a staggering $248,000 a month, which she claims is "less than the amount needed to maintain the children in their accustomed lifestyle."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Costner has been reluctant to remit the specified amount, claiming that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his ex-wife intends to use the funds for herself, and not their kids</a>. "Christine allocates 60 percent of expenses such as private trainer, unallocated credit card expenses, and her plastic surgery to the minor children without any explanation or basis."</p><p>Costner wrote in court documents obtained by US Weekly. "The children do not use the services of private trainers, only Christine does. The plastic surgery expenses of $188,500/month belong to Christine – not the children.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kevin-costner-and-ex-wife-christine-baumgartner.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Yellowstone star has also admitted to being incapable of paying the requested amount, claiming that the current child support arrangement, which entitles Christine to $51,490/ month is more reasonable.</p><p>The Yellowstone alum went ahead to label his estranged ex-wife’s request “astonishing,” claiming that he couldn’t “afford to pay those amounts and pay [his] living and business expenses without liquidating assets.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About The Crazy Rumor About Kevin Costner And This Celebrity's Wife</a></span></p><p>As for why he’s suddenly short on cash, Costner claimed, "I will earn substantially less in 2023 than I did in 2022. This is because I am no longer under contract for Yellowstone, the principal source of my income last year. The fixed amount ‘pay or play’ and episodic compensation I received has ceased. Now, any compensation I earn from Yellowstone will derive only from my back-end contractual participation rights, which amounts are not fixed."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the meantime, Baumgartner has declined to move out of Costner's $145 million Santa Barbara estate, claiming that she “does not have sufficient funding to secure housing that will ensure the children can maintain similar standards of living.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiumqtdmLWztdKtoKedXZeutrnGmqmtppWneq%2Bx02auqKqknXq0vMSnm6Kml2KutHnCq5izsV2WwG63xK%2Bgp2WTpMC1usSrqmaalZu8s7GMrZ%2BeoaJisLC6056lraGfqsBusMivpqublWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-most-expensive-items-on-tv-show-pawn-stars-ranked.html><span>←</span><span>The Most Expensive Items On TV Show Pawn Stars, Ranked</span></a>
