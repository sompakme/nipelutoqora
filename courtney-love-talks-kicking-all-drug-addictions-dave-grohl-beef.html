There are no more drugs.”</p><p>After spending time in rehab in the mid-2000s, the former wild child stopped using. She told host Letterman, 67, that her sobriety was also aided by religious practices.</p><p>“What really saved me was, obviously going to meetings and stuff like that, but I’m a Buddhist,” she spilled. “I chant and I’m really serious about it. I chant twice a day.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m Nichiren Buddhist so it’s Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo,” Love continued, referencing the <a href=#>devotional mantra</a>. “So I sit there in the morning, ‘Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo, Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo, Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo,’ and it changed my life.

The two were in a fierce private and public battle, suing one another over Cobain and Nirvana’s assets and making personal attacks.</p><p>“We’re friends again,” she said of Grohl, whom she reconciled with last year. “We text and we’re cool. I think you just get to an age where… ‘Why are we suing each other?’ I mean, really. Honestly, it just got stupid.”</p><p>“Me and Dave Grohl, we had some gnarly times over 20 years,” Love quipped. “If we can make up, anyone can make up.
