It’s all the single parents out there working hard, trying to earn a living and provide for their children. It’s not an easy task. As the child of a single mother, I watched her work two jobs and still be able to be there for my sister and I, taking us to track practice, dance recitals, football games, and Girl Scout meetings. In Hollywood, this has to be all the more difficult, given all the traveling that a working actor has to do. Sure, they make more money and can afford a nanny or someone to help them out; however, you’d be surprised how many single parents in Hollywood struggle to be sure they are there for their children whenever possible. Now, you might hear about the single moms of Tinseltown, but we never hear about all the single fathers who balance celebrity living with raising their children, often out of the spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Several celebrity single dads have joint or sole custody of children; some from failed marriages or relationships that just didn’t pan out. Some adopt or have children via surrogates. Some are pretty open about their role as single fathers; others keep their family lives pretty quiet and you would probably not have even known that they had kids. This list contains information about some of the biggest male celebrities out there who are making it happen and raising their kids on their own. Some are sports stars, some are movie stars, and some are music stars. Regardless of occupation or the situation that found them doing it solo, these celebrities are taking their parenting obligations seriously.</p><h2 id=tom-cruise><strong>Tom Cruise</strong></h2><p>I think it’s safe to say that Tom Cruise is one of the biggest stars in the world and is pretty much well-known throughout as well. From Top Gun (1986) to Jerry Maguire (1996) to the Mission: Impossible franchise, Cruise consistently puts his all into his films. Though he’s known for his devotion to his film projects, he is not one to sacrifice family for work. Cruise is still a devoted single dad. First, when he was married to Nicole Kidman. The pair adopted two children, Isabella Jane Kidman Cruise, born 1992, and Connor Antony Cruise, born 1995.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>When Tom and Nicole divorced in 2001, Kidman didn’t really maintain that strong of a relationship with her adopted children, admitting that they don’t even really call her “mom.”</strong></p><p>Cruise was left to raise them himself and accepted some help from his two sisters, who homeschooled the two children when Tom was away on film shoots. Cruise also has a daughter, Suri, with his third wife, Katie Holmes; however, after the pair divorced in 2012, it has been reported that he doesn’t see Suri very often, some say it is due to Cruise’s affiliation with Scientology, which is heartbreaking. Here’s hoping whatever issues have come between Holmes and Cruise, Suri won’t be caught in the middle for long.</p><h2 id=johnny-depp><strong>Johnny Depp</strong></h2><p>Johnny Depp never married his long-time girlfriend, Vanessa Paradis, however, the duo does have two children together, Lily-Rose and Jack Depp. Both were born in France, where Depp and Paradis shared a home. Lily-Rose was born May 27, 1999, and Jack was born April 9, 2002. When the couple split in 2012, Depp became a single father, as the two children stayed with him. Lily-Rose was in her early teens, while young Jack was just 10 years old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Depp has always been very vocal about his love for children and, if you listen to the filmmaker, Kevin Smith, whose daughter Harley is close friends with Lily-Rose, Depp is one of the best fathers around.</strong></p><p>In 2007, Lily-Rose suffered a severe infection, causing her kidneys to start to fail. Depp was distraught and sought care at the Great Ormond Street Hospital. Thankfully, the incredible staff of doctors and nurses cared for Lily-Rose until she was back to full-strength! In gratitude for all they had done, Depp dressed up as Jack Sparrow and spent a considerable amount of time hanging out with other children at the hospital. Lily-Rose has grown up to become a beautiful model and aspiring actress, while Jack is becoming the little spitting image of his good-looking father.</p><h2 id=al-pacino><strong>Al Pacino</strong></h2><p>Can you believe that Al Pacino has never been married? The award-winning thespian does have three children from previous relationships. He has twins, Anton James and Olivia Rose, with the&nbsp;actress, Beverly D’Angelo. He also has a daughter, Julie Marie, with Jan Tarrant, his acting coach. Julie Marie is a screenwriter and producer in her own right, but what can you expect from the daughter of an acting legend and his acting coach? Pacino is very private but they say he has a strong relationship with D’Angelo and, after what was at first a bitter custody battle, the pair share their responsibilities and time in raising the children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The key thing is creating a new history, and moving on from whatever dissolved that relationship to the new one of co-parenting,” D’Angelo explained. “The most important thing I’ve learned is how vital acceptance is… You have to accept differences and all the things that led to a breakup in a way that allows you to move forward. And out of my support system and people I know and love, I’ve created the ideal partner.” Since Pacino didn’t really have a relationship with his own father, it’s fair to say he has been quite resolute to ensure his own children don’t have to go through that as well.</p><h2 id=usher><strong>Usher</strong></h2><p>When the award-winning pop star, Usher, born Usher Raymond IV, divorced his wife,&nbsp;Tameka Foster, in June 2009, the two began a three-year bitter custody battle over their two sons. Each fought for sole custody, which Usher eventually won when he told the court Foster didn’t have a strong bond with her children and was unstable. I don’t know Foster and can’t attest to that, but in August 2012, the court agreed with Usher and granted him sole custody. The children, Usher “Cinco” Raymond V, born in November 2007, and Naviyd Ely Raymond, born in December 2008, now reside solely with Usher. Foster has attempted a few times to re-open the custody case, chiefly in August 2013, after Usher V nearly drowned in his father’s pool after getting his arm caught in the drain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Foster was seeking a temporary primary custody order citing the near-death accident as evidence of a lack of supervision for her children. The case was dismissed and even Foster publicly stated she can’t blame Usher for the incident and that he has consistently proven to be a great father. Don’t believe me? Just check out his Twitter feed, it’s full of snapshots of Usher and his boys!</p><h2 id=cristiano-ronaldo><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong></h2><p>He is a world-renowned soccer player, arguably the most bankable athlete in the most popular sport in the world, and everyone wants him, from other soccer clubs to screaming women and fans. Do you know who always gets his full and undivided attention? His son, Cristiano Jr. In June 2010, Ronaldo publicly announced that he was a single father and has sole custody of his son. He’s known to be single and has never revealed the identity of the child’s mother.</p><p><strong>There have been rumors floating around as to the identity of his baby mama, and some say he paid top dollar to be sure that whoever the woman is, she’ll stay quiet.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But those are just rumors and realistically, we have no idea. Granted, Ronaldo has a tough and busy schedule and he admits that his own mother, Dolores Aveiro, had been gracious enough to pitch in and help with babysitting when he was away. Ronaldo has stated that, eventually, when he’s ready, he’ll tell his son about his mother, but he’ll never announce it to the public. In 2017, he legally assumed sole custody of twins, Eva Maria and Mateo, again, he won’t release the name of the mother.</p><h2 id=jamie-foxx><strong>Jamie Foxx</strong></h2><p>Actor-singer-comedian, Jamie Foxx, can do it all! What other occupation can you add to this already impressive multi-hyphenate? Accomplished single father. Most people aren’t aware Foxx is a single dad, and he worked hard to keep his children out of the spotlight. Foxx is the doting father of two daughters, Corrine Foxx and Annalise Bishop. Corrine Foxx is actually already 24 years old and a model and an actress who just signed with Creative Artists Agency (CAA). Annalise is only 8 years old, but we’re sure when she’s ready, she’ll unleash herself on the world with some of that talent that we know is in her veins.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>When Corrine worked the runway during designer Sherri Hill’s show at the 2017 New York Fashion Week, Foxx admitted, “In this business, sometimes it can get crazy, but my daughter, she’s just incredible… It was just a great moment.”</strong></p><p>On Anelise, his youngest, “It’s amazing to see our kids grow up. We’re so proud of them,” Foxx told People magazine. “They ended up being okay.” The two girls are actually half-sisters and the identities of their mothers have never been publicly announced. Foxx is very secretive and has never really had a verified public relationship or been married (I guess there’s this whole Katie Holmes thing? Is that a thing?).</p><h2 id=lenny-kravitz><strong>Lenny Kravitz</strong></h2><p>Rocker and all-around soulful dude, Lenny Kravitz, ran off to Las Vegas to secretly marry his girlfriend, Lisa Bonet, back in 1987. A year later, Bonet gave birth to their child, the lovely, Zoë Isabella Kravitz. Even though Kravitz and Bonet divorced in 1993, they have remained on good terms, with Lenny even being tight with Bonet’s new husband, Jason Momoa! I mean, seriously, if you look up photos you’d see so many of the three of them together it’s almost like Bonet has two husbands! So, it’s clear Kravitz and Bonet have remained good friends, which has benefitted Zoë tremendously.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Kravitz once revealed that his marriage to Lisa Bonet was wonderful, but that they were both too young.</strong></p><p>Kravitz once dated model, Kate Moss, actress, Nicole Kidman, singer, Kylie Minogue, and was engaged to supermodel, Adriana Lima, however, the best thing that ever happened to him, according to Kravitz, is having his daughter Zoë. Zoë is now a grown woman, and a successful actress, co-starring in the upcoming Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. However, Kravitz stays in contact, offering support and career advice when needed. What a lucky woman. I mean, think about it, Zoë’s father is Lenny Kravitz, and her stepfather is Khal Drogo/Aquaman! Too cool!</p><h2 id=idris-elba><strong>Idris Elba</strong></h2><p>The prospective future Mr. James Bond, Idris Elba is currently content with being Mr. Mom. Elba is the father to two children, daughter, Isan, age 16, and son, Winston, age 4. Isan is the daughter of Idris and his ex-wife, makeup artist Hanne Kim Norgaard. Norgaard and Elba were married from 1999-2003, but their split didn’t prevent Elba from doting on his beautiful daughter. Isan currently resides with her mother in Atlanta, Georgia. However, that didn’t leave Elba alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Elba had begun dating his British makeup artist, Naiyana Garth, and she gave birth to their son, Winston, in April 2014. Though Elba is no longer dating Garth, his commitment to his children has not diminished.</strong></p><p>Eldra once stated in a Cosmopolitan magazine that “[he] loves being a dad; it’s an important part of [his] life." He added, “children don’t raise themselves,” and that “you’ve got to be there to guide them and help them through it.” Later, he told People magazine, “the magic of watching their personalities form uniquely to them and watching them form on things that you and their mum have taught them and things they remember, that is really truly human magic.”</p><h2 id=charles-prince-of-wales><strong>Charles, Prince of Wales</strong></h2><p>He is Charles, Prince of Wales, heir to the British throne; but, to millions around the world, he was husband to the beautiful and elegant, Princess Diana. It was a fairytale romance and the whole world watched it unfold, and then, unfortunately, come to a tragic end. After Charles and Diana divorced in 1996, the Prince of Wales became a single father to their sons, Harry and William. Princess Diana tragically passed away in a car accident the following year. The world mourned but for Charles, family life, especially one so much in the public eye, had to continue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>He had to raise his children, attempting to shield them from the spotlight as much as possible in their early years and provide them as much of a normal childhood as he could.</strong></p><p>In 2005, Prince Charles married Camilla Parker Bowles, now styled the Duchess of Cornwall. The two royal children have grown to become celebrities in their own right. Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is second in line to the throne, while Prince Harry is engaged to American actress Meghan Markle. Their upcoming royal wedding has made headlines around the world! I’d say Prince Charles should be quite proud of raising two such fine young men!</p><h2 id=seal><strong>Seal</strong></h2><p>In 2005, British-born singer/songwriter, Seal, married German supermodel, Heidi Klum. They seemed like the ideal couple and always appeared to be living an idyllic life together. However, as is most the case for high-profile couples, a fairy tale life together was not to be. The pair divorced in 2014, leaving Seal a single father to the couple’s four beautiful children. When they first began dating, Klum was pregnant with a child from her ex, Flavio Briatore. Briatore respected Klum’s wishes and has stayed away, while Seal was by her side on May 2004, when she gave birth to her first child, Helene “Leni” Boshoven Klum. Seal adopted Leni, and the couple had three children of their own: sons, Henry Günther Adeola Dashtu Samuel (born September 2005), Johan Riley Fyodor Taiwo Samuel (born November 2006), and daughter, Lou Sulola Samuel (born October 2009).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Klum has always commended Seal for his good parenting skills, “When I first met Seal he had a kindness and compassion that was so sincere I knew he'd be a good father...But it wasn't until Leni was born and we had our three other children that I grasped what a great dad he is...He has infinite amounts of love and patience for our kids...He puts me and the children first.” Though the couple is no longer together, they continue to put their children first and can be seen still out together on family days.</p><h2 id=david-arquette><strong>David Arquette</strong></h2><p>I wonder if it was written into his wedding vows that if anything were to ever happen, the&nbsp;Friends star, Courtney Cox, had to remain “friends” (see what I did there…) with husband, David Arquette? Levity aside, after 11 years of marriage, Courtney Cox and David Arquette did remain friends after their 2010 separation. The 2013 divorce proceeded smoothly and without bitterness from either side. That is always great to hear, especially when there are children to consider. The couple has one daughter, Coco Arquette, born 2004. Both Arquette and Cox spend time with their daughter separately; though they insist publicly that they both remain on friendly terms with each other, just trying to lead separate lives. They do schedule family time every now and again where they agree to put their differences aside for Coco’s sake. “She’s just so beautiful… she’s the love of my life,” David once said about Coco. In 2011, Arquette appeared on the television dance competition series,&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars, where Cox brought Coco and they can be seen in the audience cheering him on. Arquette has since gotten engaged to fiancé Christina McLarty, and the couple has a child of their own, Charlie West.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dwyane-wade><strong>Dwyane Wade</strong></h2><p>Professional basketball star, Dwyane Wade, is a superstar on and off the court. He’s a 3-time NBA champion and a consistent All-Star quality player and all business when he’s playing. When he’s off the court, he still earns the MVP for fulfilling single dad duties like a champ. Wade divorced his first wife, high school sweetheart, Siohvaughn Funches, in 2010. Wade subsequently assumed full-time custody of his two sons with her in 2011. His boys are Zion and Zaire, ages 10 and 16, respectively, and Dahveion, age 16, the son of Wade’s sister Deanna, whom he is also raising. Wade explained he found inspiration for raising the boys as a single father by remembering his own father who stepped up while his mother was going through hard times.</p><p><strong>“All children need their fathers, but boys especially need fathers to teach them how to be men. I remember wanting that so badly before I went to live with my dad.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wade hopes to inspire other single fathers out there and wrote a book in 2012, A Father First: How My Life Became Bigger Than Basketball. He also accepted an invitation by President Barack Obama to join a national parenting program that encourages fathers to be more involved in the lives of the children. Looks like Wade is now getting some help in the raising-kids department. In 2014, he married his girlfriend, actress, Gabrielle Union.</p><h2 id=ryan-phillippe><strong>Ryan Phillippe</strong></h2><p>Ryan Phillippe is the star of the USA network series,&nbsp;Shooter, though most probably know him from his roles in the award-nominated films,&nbsp;Gosford Park and Crash; oh, who am I kidding, everyone remembers him from Cruel Intentions (1999), where he starred with his soon-to-be wife, America’s sweetheart, Reese Witherspoon. Well, Phillippe and Witherspoon got married that same year and had two wonderful children together, Ava and Deacon. Unfortunately, their marriage only lasted nine years and the couple divorced in 2008. At that time, Phillippe became a single dad to the children, Ava Elizabeth, born 1999, and Deacon Reese, born 2003.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The couple shared joint custody and the children get to spend equal amounts of time with both parents. The two exes are very good at sharing the parenting workload.</strong></p><p>Phillippe claims to have learned much from being a parent, stating, “I learn from my kids. I hope that they are learning from me, as well. There is that give-and-take that happens as you age along with your kids… You cannot spend all the time thinking about yourself. You have to focus on these two children who depend on you. It keeps me balanced.” Phillippe also has a 7-year-old daughter, Kailani “Kai” Merizalde, with former girlfriend, Alexis Knapp.</p><h2 id=james-marsden><strong>James Marsden</strong></h2><p>Westworld actor, James Marsden, might be best known for his multiple outings as the Scott Summers in the X-Men film franchise, but he’s also on our list of notable single fathers. Marsden married daytime drama actress, Mary Elizabeth “Lisa” Linde, in July 2000. The couple had two children, son, Jack Holden, born February 1, 2001, and daughter, Mary James, born August 10, 2005. In late 2011, Linde filed for divorce, leaving Marsden a single dad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though the couple is no longer together, they do share their parenting duties in an attempt to keep their children’s lives as normal as can be. Marsden also has a son from former girlfriend, Rose Costa, named William Luca Costa-Marsden, born December 14, 2012. His eldest, Jack, is 17 years old and will probably earn his own set of fans, as he is growing into the spitting image of his father, albeit a blonde version. Marsden says he strives to&nbsp;have his children to stay true to their hearts and to always have respect for others; good advice. Another bit of wisdom he’s trying to pass on includes, "…kids and I still fly coach -- not first-class. I think I have a certain responsibility to let my children know I am not special because of what I do, but who I am as a person." He also adds that he pretty much doesn’t have to worry about Jack as he’s already a pretty savvy guy.</p><h2 id=nelly><strong>Nelly</strong></h2><p>Hip-hop star, Nelly, is also a pretty good actor. Have you seen him in BET’s Real Husbands of Hollywood? Hilarious! Another role he’s good at, albeit one he performs out of the spotlight, is that of a single father. Trying to remain as private as possible, Nelly has actually been raising his two children. He has a daughter, Chanel Haynes, born February 27, 1994, and a son, Cornell “Tre” Haynes III, born March 2, 1999. Ask any parent and they’ll admit raising children is difficult; fulfilling and joyous, but difficult, nonetheless. What makes it even more so is raising someone else’s children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Not only is Nelly raising his own two kids, but he is also the legal guardian of his niece and nephew, Sydney and Sean Thomas.</strong></p><p>The two siblings are the children of Nelly’s older sister, Jackie Donahue. The 31-year-old Donahue tragically lost her 3-year battle with leukemia in March 2005. Nelly, known for his tough street guy persona, is actually quite generous and loving and didn’t hesitate to take in and raise his sister’s kids. Of course, don’t go thinking he’s gone soft. Nelly is quick to publicly defend his children vigorously on Instagram after trolls leave mean comments on their photos. Of course, he’s not just there for his own children, as every year he sends two youths from disadvantaged backgrounds to college. Now, that’s making a difference.</p><h2 id=peter-facinelli><strong>Peter Facinelli</strong></h2><p>Actor, Peter Facinelli, known for his role on the CBS series,&nbsp;Supergirl, or more notably, as Carlisle in the Twilight franchise, was married to former Beverly Hills 90210 star, Jennie Garth. The pair split in 2012, not from infidelity or anything like that, but, as often happens when one partner’s career suddenly takes off, Garth grew jealous of Facinelli’s sudden fame. So, after twelve years together, the couple divorced in 2013, leaving Facinelli in the role of single dad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple had three daughters together: Luca Bella, born on June 29, 1997; Lola Ray, born on December 6, 2002; and, Fiona Eve, born on September 30, 2006. Facinelli and Garth agreed to divide up the parenting duties in order for the girls to stay with their mother for a bit and then go spend a month with their father. Facinelli has stated that being a single father has given him a better appreciation for the wonders of parenthood. He says that he has bonded much more with his girls after the divorce, finding it hard to be apart from them. “It definitely gets challenging at times. I travel a lot more now, and it’s never easy having to leave the kids, even if it’s for a few days,” says Facinelli.</p><h2 id=sean-combs><strong>Sean Combs</strong></h2><p>Sean Combs, P. Diddy, Diddy, Puff Daddy, …Puffy? Whatever you call him, you can also call him a single father. Actually, you can call him ultra-mega-single-father. Combs has five children with three different women and is doing just fine with the single pops routine. His oldest is Justin, born in 1993, to Combs’ high school sweetie, Misa Hylton-Brim. Combs then had an on-again, off-again relationship with Kimberly Porter that lasted over a decade. Together, they had a son, Christian, born in 1998, and twin daughters, D’Lila Star and Jessie James, both December 2006. Five months later, Combs’s daughter, Chance, was born to Sarah Chapman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He assumed legal guardianship of Chance in October 2007. Oh, I guess we should revise that tally to six children. You see Kimberly Porter had a son, Quincy, born 1991, from a previous relationship, who Combs also raised. Though not legally his stepfather, Quincy has been welcomed into the Combs family. In fact, though they don’t all share the same biological mother, all the children are said to be quite close. It’s quite a testament to Combs’ abilities as a father to have such a loving and inviting home. Actually, really loving… for Justin’s 16th birthday, Combs gifted him his own exclusive $400,000 Maybach, complete with a driver! I’d like to be adopted, please!</p><h2 id=bob-geldof><strong>Bob Geldof</strong></h2><p>He is Bob Geldof, the Irish singer-songwriter, author, and political activist. Most might know him as frontman for the '80s new wave band, The Boomtown Rats, or as the co-writer of “Do They Know It’s Christmas?” one of the best-selling singles of all-time, and as the co-founder of the '80s supergroup, Band Aid, formed to raise money for Ethiopian famine relief. Wherever you know Geldof from, his family has made headlines for years, always for tragic reasons. After a decade together, in 1986, Geldof married rock journalist, Paula Yates. The couple already had a daughter, Fifi Trixibelle, born March 31, 1983. The couple had two more daughters, Peaches, born March 13, 1989, and Little Pixie, born September 17, 1990. In 1996, Geldof and Yates divorced, with Yates moving in with INXS singer, Michael Hutchence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hutchence committed suicide in 1997, with Yates trying to kill herself the following year. Geldof applied for and was awarded sole custody of his daughters. In 2000, Yates died of&nbsp;an overdose, at which point, Geldof adopted her daughter, Tiger Lily, whose father was Michael Hutchence, so she could be with her half-sisters. Tragedy struck again on April 7, 2014, when Peaches died of an overdose and was found in her home. The girls always hated his music and found his fame a little embarrassing, you know, typical kids. For his part, Geldof is a doting father and incredibly devoted to his daughters. The world mourned with his family.</p><h2 id=liam-neeson><strong>Liam Neeson</strong></h2><p>I think it’s pretty safe to say that many of us want Liam Neeson to be our father. After all, he has a particular set of skills and, if taken, he will find us and exact retribution on the perpetrators! I mean, seriously, fans around the world ask him to record phone messages for them outlining his “particular set of skills.” To his actual children, he’s just “dad.” Back in 1994, Neeson married actress, Natasha Richardson, and the couple had two children together: Micheál Richard Antonio, born June 22, 1995, and Daniel Jack, born August 27, 1996. Sadly, on March 18, 2009, while on holiday in Quebec, Canada, Natasha Richardson&nbsp;passed away in a skiing accident. The loss was understandably devastating for his family, but Neeson still endeavors to be the best single father around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It doesn’t hurt when you get a little assistance from famous friends like U2’s Bono, who supported Neeson after the tragedy. Bono told Neeson’s sons that he also lost his mother at a young age. He stressed that in the end, they would be okay. “…I could have kissed him for it,” Neeson to Anderson Cooper. “It’s an ongoing joy being a dad,” Neeson says. “It’s always a joy, but it’s a joyful worry.” We think Neeson’s doing just fine.</p><h2 id=rick-moranis><strong>Rick Moranis</strong></h2><p>If they gave an annual award for single fathers, Rick Moranis has my vote for the lifetime achievement award. Why,&nbsp;do you ask? Well, here goes. Moranis is famous for his comedy roles in films like Spaceballs (1987), Ghostbusters (1984), Honey I Shrunk the Kids (1989), and Little Shop of Horrors (1986). However, in 1997, at the height of his career, he stepped away and hasn’t been seen on screen since. Moranis was married to costume designer, Ann Belsky, in 1986. Together they had two children, Rachel and Mitchell. When Ann succumbed to cancer and passed away in February 1991, Moranis was left&nbsp;to be a single father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After appearing in a few successful films in the few years following his wife’s death, Moranis decided it was enough. He decided he didn’t want to sacrifice being with his children for the sake of a few more dollars in his bank account. Luckily, he had been financially secure for some time and officially retired to be a stay-at-home dad. He later explained in a USA Today interview, “I'm a single parent and I just found that it was too difficult to manage to raise my kids and to do the traveling involved in making movies. So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it." He has admitted that the time he got to spend with his children was totally worth it!</p><p>References: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">foxnews.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rollingout.com</a>, <a href=#>celebritybabies.people.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">digitalspy.com</a>, <a href=#>thetalko.com</a>, <a href=#>celebritydirt.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">femalefirst.co.uk</a>, <a href=#>imdb.com</a>, <a href=#>brainyquote.com</a>, <a href=#>dailymail.co.uk</a>, <a href=#>usatoday.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqYGK6orjEZpqepJWXwG7Dx6hkq5mZqLJuwMeeoKtlm56xtHnOp2StoJWev2671qdm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-jerry-seinfeld-s-daughter-sascha.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Jerry Seinfeld's Daughter, Sascha?</span></a>
