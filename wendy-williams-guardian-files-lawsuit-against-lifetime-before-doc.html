(presumed to be Williams, whose legal name is Wendy Williams Hunter) by filing her motion.</p><p class=p1>According to TMZ, Morrissey filed the lawsuit under seal and requested a temporary restraining order. A hearing is scheduled for next week.</p><p class=p1>Neither A&E Television Networks, the parent company of Lifetime, nor Williams, 59, have further addressed the lawsuit. <i>Us Weekly </i>has reached out for comment. A rep for A&E told Us on Friday, February 23, that Lifetime “appeared in court today” and the documentary will “air this weekend as planned.”</p><p class=p1>Williams and her inner circle, including 23-year-old son Kevin, will explain her ongoing health and legal battles in a new Lifetime documentary. <i>Where Is Wendy Williams? </i>has a two-night premiere on Saturday, February 24, and Sunday, February 25.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/wendy-williams-guardian-files-lawsuit-against-lifetime-before-doc-02.jpg><p class=p1>“I have no money and I’m gonna tell you something. If this can happen to me, it can happen to you,” Williams said in <a href=#>the doc trailer</a>, breaking down in tears. “How dare he? I control me! I miss my family. Please be here. … We all make choices in life, we all go through our challenges.”</p><p class=p1>Williams’ personal struggles initially made headlines in February 2022 when it was revealed that she was taking a hiatus from season 13 of <i>The Wendy Williams Show</i>. That same month, her bank Wells Fargo called her an “incapacitated person” and requested a hearing to determine whether Williams might need guardianship to manage her finances.</p><p class=p1>Williams’ attorney, however, filed an emergency petition and claimed Wells Fargo denied her access to her assets.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Wendy wants the world to know that she strenuously denies all allegations about her mental health and well-being,” her lawyer <strong>LaShawn Thomas</strong> said in a statement at the time. “Wendy wants you to know she is fine; she is of sound mind. … Wendy is grateful for the love and the outpouring of support she has received from her fans and she can’t wait to get back.”</p><p class=p1><i>The Wendy Williams Show</i> wrapped for good in June 2022. Three months later, Williams entered an<a href=#> in-patient treatment program</a> for “overall health issues.”</p><p class=p1>Williams is currently receiving treatment for <a href=#>frontotemporal dementia and aphasia</a>, which she was diagnosed with in late 2023 after memory challenges.
