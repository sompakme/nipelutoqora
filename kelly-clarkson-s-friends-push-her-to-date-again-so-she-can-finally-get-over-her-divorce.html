But earlier this year, the singer was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quick to deny that she had a special someone</a> in her life at the moment.</p><p>"Do I have a boyfriend? No! And not looking. You know why? I love being single," Kelly said in December. "I have two kids, two dogs, three rabbits, a hamster, multiple jobs — there's a lot going on.”</p><p>She also implied that she may not be fully moved on from the end of her marriage to Blackstock. “And, you know, you think you're going to spend the rest of your life with somebody, and you don't. That's hard to start over,” Kelly went on.</p><p>Kelly and Brandon were married from 2013 to 2012 and share two kids. To settle their divorce, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly had to give her ex a one-time payment of $1.3 million</a> as well as $115,000 in spousal support plus $45,000 in child support on a monthly basis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-is-making-a-lot-of-big-life-changes-post-divorce>Kelly Is Making A Lot Of Big Life Changes Post-Divorce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kelly-clarkson-at-the-premiere-of-nbc-s-american-song-contest.jpg><p>But Kelly has been making a lot of big life changes recently. Earlier this month, the singer revealed <a href=#>she made the decision to leave Los Angeles</a> and relocate to New York, where she can also film her television program The Kelly Clarkson Show.</p><p>“I’ll be real honest: I thought I was making a horrible decision,” she told USA Today. “I knew I needed a fresh start and couldn’t be in LA.” Kelly moved to Los Angeles after separating from her ex-husband.</p><p>“I really wanted to be in Montana, but you can’t really do a show from there quite yet. So I was like, ‘The only other option would probably be New York,’” she continued. “At this point, I’m 40 years old. Mama rented something nice!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kelly-clarkson-at-the-premiere-of-nbc-s-american-song-contest.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Truth About Why Kelly Clarkson Doesn't Want Her Daughter To Be A Singer</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>While she wants to be a supportive mother, Kelly Clarkson has no intention of pushing her children into a musical career</span><p>Moreover, it appears Kelly has been transforming her life in other ways, as fans have noticed she’s undergone a physical transformation recently, as new photos show a slimmed-down physique.</p><p>While Kelly has received praise for the supposed weight loss, she’s also faced criticism, with some fans questioning how she’s appeared to slim down so quickly. <a href=#>Kelly has even faced accusations of using Ozempic</a>, a weight loss drug that’s been criticized for being increasingly prescribed in recent months.</p><p>For now, Kelly has refused to deny the speculation around her weight, but she has addressed it in the past and denied using medication, rather crediting her weight loss to lifestyle and dietary changes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqScrnqkuMCroqynnqh6p77InqWdq12lwrS0jJ2YrZ1dlrSitc1mnaKmkaG5unnGnqtmp6aav26wyK%2Bmq5uVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joe-alwyn-sick-of-being-seen-as-taylor-swift-s-ex-sources-claim.html><span>←</span><span>Joe Alwyn Sick Of Being Seen As Taylor Swift's Ex, Sources Claim</span></a>
