The popular <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> company announced on Monday, September 24, that it plans to revamp itself in a variety of ways, starting with its name.</p><p>From now on, Weight Watchers will simply be known as WW. “To reflect the next stage of the company’s evolution to focus on overall health and wellness, Weight Watchers International announced that the company will become WW, honoring its legacy while broadening the role it plays in helping everyone live healthier lives,” a <a href=#>press release</a> explained.</p><p>With the new moniker comes a new tagline – “Wellness that Works” – which will be used globally to reflect the company’s heritage and overall approach to health and well-being.</p><p>“We are committed to always being the best weight management program on the planet, but now we’re putting our decades of knowledge and expertise in behavioral science to work for an even greater mission,” Mindy Grossman, president and chief executive officer of WW, said in the press release. “We are becoming the world’s partner in wellness. No matter what your goal is – to lose weight, eat healthier, move more, develop a positive mind-set, or all of the above – we will deliver science-based solutions that fit into people’s lives.”</p><p>One person who is very excited about Weight Watchers’ updates is <a href=#><strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong></a>, who is a WW spokeswoman, investor and board member. “From the moment I chose to invest in the company and join the board, I have believed that the role WW can play in people’s lives goes far beyond a number on the scale,” Winfrey explained as part of the press release. “As Weight Watchers becomes WW, I believe we will continue to inspire people not only to eat well, but to move more, connect with others and continue to experience the joys of a healthy life.”</p><p>Other changes coming to WW include updates to the newly-enhanced WW app. Starting on Thursday, October 4, a new initiative called WellnessWins will reward members for small, everyday behaviors that are proven to lead to healthier habits. From there, members can earn “Wins,” which can then be redeemed for exclusive products, services and experiences designed to inspire members on their wellness journeys.</p><p>Given WW’s increased focus on overall health and wellness, the company is also partnering with Headspace, a global leader in meditation and mindfulness. Together with Headspace, WW plans to develop customized content for members with the goal of reducing stress.</p><p>And while members will still count points as they eat throughout the day, the brand’s new Fit Points 2.0 encourage activity choices based on what will have the greatest impact on an individual’s health and wellness. In order to achieve that, the new FitPoints will be personalized to each individual within the WW app – based on their height, weight, age and sex – so members know exactly what each activity is worth to them.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>What’s more? New voice integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant will enable WW members to use their voices to look up SmartPoints values for food, get updates on their progress and more.</p><p>Added Grossman: “This is just the beginning of our journey to become the world’s partner in wellness, and I am inspired by the potential for our impact.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZrCdmZy1tXnWmqucoJWnwG6%2BxJupmqaUqHq4tdOhZJ%2Bnk6rAbrvNZqavnaKWua15x56YpayYYq6vsIywnKWknprAtHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./viola-davis-shares-sweet-mother-daughter-moment-post-emmy-s.html><span>←</span><span>Viola Davis Shares Sweet Mother-Daughter Moment Post Emmy's</span></a>
