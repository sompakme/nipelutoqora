During that time he has had amazing guests on and only encounted a few glitches with interview along the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because of this, Kimmel has gotten himself a loyal following of viewers. This helps with the Nielsen ratings so that a contact worth a whopping $15 million per year could be negotiated for hosting his talk show.</p><p>Making this kind of cash has allowed Kimmel to invest it wisely, with real estate being a favored way. And if the ratings remain stable or climb, Kimmel will likely receive a larger salary the next time negotiations roll around, meaning that much more can be invested in.</p><h2 id=jimmy-kimmel-has-a-50-million-net-worth>Jimmy Kimmel Has A $50 Million Net Worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar48630833-1.jpg><p>As one of the most popular hosts on television, and as someone who has been in the entertainment industry for years now, Jimmy Kimmel is a star that millions of TV fans are familiar with.

In 2004, Jimmy paid $2.175 million for a home one block from the beach in Hermosa Beach, California," according to Celebrity Net Worth. "He bought a second home in Hermosa in 2014 for $2.25 million. At some point, he deeded this home to his wife's sister.</p><p>In 2018 he dropped $8.2 million on yet another home in Hermosa. The current home on this lot is a modest 2,200 square-foot structure. According to the sale plans, a future home could be 20,000 square-feet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Outside of Hermosa, Jimmy owns a $7.1 million two-parcel home in the Hollywood Hills above the famed Chateau Marmont."</p><p>With that said, let's shift our focus to his work on TV.

It was a show that was wildly popular, and Kimmel, who co-created the show with several others, was its host for the majority of its time on air.</p><p>Thanks to the success of The Man Show, Kimmel started making great money. Not only that, but more opportunities were beginning to open themselves up for him. This is initially how he was making a ton of money in the industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During that same time, Kimmel also co-created and lent his voice to the hit series CrankYankers.

Kimmel has been hosting that show for nearly 20 years, and this is the primary driving force behind his current net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, "Jimmy Kimmel is probably most famous for hosting the late-night comedy talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live, for which he earns an annual salary of $15 million. He has hosted the show since 2003."</p><p>That's right, Jimmy Kimmel is making $15 million annually for hosting his show. Combine this with money that he's made for hosting major awards shows, and for appearing on various shows through the years, and you have yourself a recipe for major financial success.</p><p>Not long ago, however, Kimmel opened up about the future of his hit show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sharing some uncertainty about it</a>.</p><p>"I wish I knew what I was gonna do. I have moments where I go, 'I cannot do this anymore.' And I have moments where I go, 'What am I gonna do with my life if I'm not doing this anymore?' It's a very complicated thing," Kimmel explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He went on to explain, "And there are practical considerations, and there are family and friend considerations and co-worker considerations. And eventually, I am going to have to stop doing this. I'm not going to do this forever. I would not be honest at all if I said that I have decided one way or the other. I’m thinking about it a lot, though."</p><p>If Kimmel calls it a day, he can sit back and enjoy his fortune.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihoqWdrnqstcymnKVlk6q%2Fs7HNrWSnnaRixLC%2B06FkrZmcoHq0tM6wZKGno6l6tK3LmqmyZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-james-corden-s-wife-julia-carey-reveal-what-she-really-thinks-about-the-allegations-against-hi.html><span>←</span><span>Did James Cordens Wife Julia Carey Reveal What She Really Thinks About The Allegations Against Hi</span></a>
