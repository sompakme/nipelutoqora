Rappers when they first become millionaires, spend their hard earned money on items such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">jewelry,</a> cars, mansions and luxury brands. Lil Uzi Vert takes his spending to a whole another level that many of his peers can't top.</p><h2 id=24-million-pink-diamond>$24 Million Pink Diamond</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Diamonds are nothing out of the ordinary for a rapper to buy, but what makes the purchase absurd is that he placed this pink diamond on his forehead. There were many reactions on social media when the news broke out and plenty made jokes about the decision. The implant only lasted about 7 months as his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">diamond got ripped </a>by a rowdy fan during his Rolling Loud set. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He claimed</a> that he could die if the diamond was not removed properly, so it's fortunate that he didn't get seriously hurt during his Rolling Loud accident.</p><h2 id=buying-a-planet>Buying a Planet</h2><p>Singer Grimes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first mentioned</a> about his potential purchase on her Twitter saying, "Documentation almost complete for <a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-1ddef8g r-tjvw6i r-qvutc0" href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@LILUZIVERT</a><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> to legally claim wasp-127b - this is huge! First human to legally own a planet." A NASA agency said "under international law, governments are not capable of granting, recognizing, or enforcing ownership interests in celestial bodies. Even the naming of such objects falls outside of NASA’s purview and is the responsibility of the International Astronomical Union." It is evident that Lil Uzi is interested about the universe outside of Earth as the cover of his 2020 album Eternal Atake has space related themes on it.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=helping-with-a-student-s-tuition>Helping With A Student's Tuition</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The relationship </a>between Uzi Vert and Temple University student Raheel Ahmad started when he spotted the rapper at a Philadelphia mall. Ahmad recorded the interaction for social media and asked him if he could pay off his $90,000 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">college tuition</a>. Uzi said he would do so if he graduated and could show him transcripts that prove his claims. People wondered if he kept his word and Ahmed stated, "I’m not allowed to specifically say anything, but I know when I graduate it’s going to be paid. Roc Nation [ a label Uzi Vert has a deal with] has put down $20k. When I met him the second time he told me Roc Nation has already put down $20k.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meek Mill Defends Billionaires Like Jay-Z After Lil Duval Diss</a></span></p><h2 id=a-pricey-first-date>A Pricey First Date</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>JT from the female rap duo City Girls shared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a story</a> about her first date with Lil Uzi Vert. She said, "I was still in a halfway house. He came to Atlanta to see me. He had a bag full of money, and I had a little Chanel bag, and he was like, ‘take as much as you can…”I could only fit US$30,000 in there." For an ordinary person that number is unthinkable, but even millionaires might be astounded hearing the price.</p><h2 id=jet-pack>Jet Pack</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not too long after his pursuit of purchasing a planet, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Uzi Vert stated</a> that he wanted to buy a jet pack that's worth $700,000. Since people are able to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">own a jet pack</a> if they want to now, he definitely has that kind of money to spend on one. Him buying a planet and getting a jet pack might have some correlation with each other.</p><h2 id=car-collection>Car Collection</h2><p>The Lil Uzi Vert twist to his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">car collection</a> is that some of them feature anime designs. It includes Bentley Continental GT<strong>, </strong>Lamborghini Urus<strong>, </strong>Bugatti Veyron and designs from animes like Cowboy Bepop and Kimi ni Todoke, which are made by Car Effex. Uzi said, "these like my kids. If I’m iced out, you think my car is not iced out?"</p><h2 id=marilyn-manson-necklace>Marilyn Manson Necklace</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Uzi Vert has cited <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marilyn Manson</a> as a musical influence and was the only person he followed on Instagram. He payed the rock star even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more homage </a>by purchasing a $220,000 Marilyn Manson necklace and the labor costing $50,000. It has 16,000 diamonds in it and 155 total carats.</p><p><span class=next-single>Read Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Once Worth $25 Million, Marilyn Manson Is On The Verge Of Going Broke</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Revolt, </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Indy 100</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hype Beast, </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">XXL Mag, </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnLoqNmraqeerex0a1knrCkp663rcaapa2kqWLAsbHNnapmoJmoeq61y6WgqKajZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frsc-salary-structure-ranks-and-departments.html><span>←</span><span>FRSC Salary Structure, Ranks and Departments</span></a>
