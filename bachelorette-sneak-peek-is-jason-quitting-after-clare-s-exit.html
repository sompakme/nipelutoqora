<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>'Bachelorette' Sneak Peek: Is Jason Quitting After Clare's Exit?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Moving on isn’t easy — especially for <strong>Jason Foster.</strong> <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a> contestant, 31, was visibly <a href=#>upset during the Thursday, November 5, episode of the reality show</a> when <a href=#><strong>Clare Crawley</strong></a> left the show.</p><p>“I’m in disbelief. I’m crushed. I don’t know if my heart is going to come out,” he said after Crawley, 39, told the group she was leaving with <a href=#><strong>Dale Moss</strong></a>. “I opened up to somebody like I’ve never done before.”</p><p>Despite being unsure if he wanted to remain on the show, he <a href=#>ultimately decided to meet the new lead</a>. However, he’s not doing so well during the Tuesday, November 10, episode after meeting the new Bachelorette, <a href=#><strong>Tayshia Adams</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Is-Jason-Quitting-After-Clare-Crawley-Exit-The-Bachelorette-Sneak-Peek.jpg><p>“I’m hanging on by a piece of floss. It’s not fair to Tayshia. If I’m gonna be here, she deserves all of me,” the former NFL player tells contestant <strong>Joe Park</strong> in Us Weekly‘s exclusive sneak peek. “I’m fighting still, but I don’t know how much more I have left, and I’m just being brutally honest with you man.”</p><p>The Virginia native continues in his confessional, admitting that it’s not easy for him to just change his feelings overnight after falling for Crawley.</p><p>“Tayshia is gorgeous. She’s given everybody the chance that we all deserve,” he notes. “But I<a href=#> can’t just flip an on and off switch</a> with somebody else. It’s just hard to move on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Tayshia-Adams-Is-Officially-the-Bachelorette.jpg><p>With that, he decides to show up to Adams’ suite at the La Quinta Resort. She’s shocked to see him arrive but quickly invites him in.</p><p>“I’m sorry to barge in. It’s late on a Sunday, I know,” he tells her. “I wanted to come and chat with you a little bit. I took this journey not knowing what to expect.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with Us, the phlebotomist, 39, admitted that she was a bit <a href=#>nervous about joining the show after the hairstylist</a>, simply because she knew the men would have already formed connections with the initial lead.</p><p>“The guys knew that it was going to be Clare, and I didn’t know if they were going to be accepting or if they were willing to open their hearts,” the <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> alum said on Monday, November 9. “If they had fallen in love, like, I didn’t know what was going on. So, it was definitely a hesitation.”</p><p>The Bachelorette airs on ABC Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2BxK2rnmWjo7Kit4ypnJ6jXZ7AbrbArKanZaGqtrXAyKeeZpmWqbKzecKlmKudo2KyubXTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ybor-city-streets-illuminated-for-annual-sant-yago-knight-parade.html><span>←</span><span>Ybor City streets illuminated for annual Sant' Yago Knight Parade</span></a>
