The show featured an insane amount of young stars, including a then-unknown Jason Segel. Recently, a former writer from the show opened up about her time on set, and how she was interested in having an affair with a young Jason Segel.</p><p>Let's take a look at this wild story, and see how things played out for these two.</p><h2 id=freaks-and-geeks-is-a-beloved-series>Freaks And Geeks Is A Beloved Series</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar29726361.jpg><p>In the annals of television history, few shows have achieved the cult status and enduring impact of Freaks and Geeks. This teenage dramedy, set in the early 1980s, remains a beloved classic that has left an indelible mark on the world of entertainment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Freaks and Geeks first aired in 1999, and while its initial run was short-lived, it has since garnered a dedicated and passionate fanbase. The show, created by Paul Feig and executive produced by Judd Apatow, was set in a Michigan high school in 1980 and focused on two groups of students: the "freaks" - a group of rebellious misfits - and the "geeks" - the socially awkward, academically inclined kids.</p><p>One of the show's standout features was its remarkably talented ensemble cast. Headlined by James Franco, Seth Rogen, Linda Cardellini, and Jason Segel, Freaks and Geeks served as a launching pad for these young actors' careers. Their performances were not only genuine but also uproariously funny.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The legacy of Freaks and Geeks extends far beyond its single season. It served as a breeding ground for some of Hollywood's most prominent talents. Judd Apatow, the show's executive producer, went on to direct and produce numerous hit comedies, many featuring the show's alumni. James Franco, Seth Rogen, and Jason Segel became comedy icons, starring in a slew of successful films.</p><p>Recently, a former writer from the show dropped a bomb about Jason Segel, and how she wanted an affair with him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About How Raquel Leviss Earns Her $30 Million Net Worth (And If The Tom Sandoval Affair Has Hurt It)</a></span></p><h2 id=patty-lin-wanted-to-have-an-affair-with-jason-segel>Patty Lin Wanted To Have An Affair With Jason Segel</h2><p>In her memoir, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, Lin detailed her feelings about Segel, and how she wanted an affair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"While I adored most of the actors [on Freaks and Geeks], I became especially close with Jason Segel. He played Nick, the drummer freak who is Lindsay’s love interest. Only 19 at the time, he wasn’t the type that made girls swoon, but he was cute. He had warm brown eyes, a goofy smile and a tall, lanky frame — like, basketball player tall. In fact, he used to play basketball, just like his character."</p><p>The actress added more, describing how Segel was on set, and her feelings about him.</p><p>"It was impossible not to like Jason. He had a positive attitude and did his job without any complaints. Not only was he an intuitive actor but a budding writer and musician as well."</p><p>Lin's honesty is refreshing, but also eye-opening. In her book, she dished more on the conversation they had that sparked feelings, and how she was disappointed when she wished for a birthday kiss, and only got a hug.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was crushed like a lovesick teenager. Maybe Jason was being honest, and if so, his moral code was impressive for a guy his age. But I had a feeling that whatever had been brewing between us was barely a blip compared to what was going on with Linda," the writer said.</p><p>The Linda that she is referring to is Linda Cardellini, who co-starred with Segel on the show. Eventually, those two did strike up a romance.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Did Kelly Preston React To John Travolta's Gay Affair Rumors Which Threatened The Legitimacy Of Their Marriage?</a></span></p><h2 id=jason-segel-instead-dated-co-star-linda-cardellini>Jason Segel Instead Dated Co-Star, Linda Cardellini</h2><p>According to multiple sources, the pair dated for a number of years, and allegedly, Cardellini was the one the ended things with Segel. This, in turn, is alleged to have inspired some elements of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, which starred Segel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was trying to experience [the breakup] viscerally, as a person. But all I could think was: ‘This is hilarious. I cannot wait for her to leave so I can write this down," Segel once said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CheatSheet</a>.</p><p>Later on, the actor dished on fans figuring out which relationship he was talking about.</p><p>“I can’t control what people think. I was still very much a child [then], and this was more an amalgamation of a lot of different relationships and breakups I’ve had. People are bound to talk, but she was a great girlfriend."</p><p>Circling back to Lin, she had a successful career in Hollywood, working on shows like Breaking Bad, Desperate Housewives, and Friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqufo3q0scaeo2aqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBisba%2ByKeeZp6imq6sv4yapZ1ll5qyrL%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./egypt-shuts-the-country-s-internet-down.html><span>←</span><span>Egypt Shuts The Countrys Internet Down</span></a>
