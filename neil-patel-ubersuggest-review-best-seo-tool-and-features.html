If I were to mention the name Lebron James, you would immediately think about basketball. Tony Robbins and you would think a motivational speaker. Neil Patel… and you would likely associate his name with online marketing and SEO.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>More often than not, SEO is the interlinking term commonly used with Neil. And this also makes perfect sense, as the release of his latest project, </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>Ubersuggest</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, is quickly becoming the go-to solution for SEO analysis and keyword research.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>With so many different <a href=# rel=noopener>marketing tools</a> and solutions on the internet today, it’s easy to find yourself left with endless accounts that you are likely paying for, yet also many that you aren’t using. This ultimately can add up to thousands of wasted dollars every year, while also leaving yourself asking what you really need?</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In short, you really only need a handful of tools and tracking solutions to run a successful business online, and many of them might have alternatives that you might find to be cheaper, yet just as good–if not better.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>A perfect case of this would be with Ubersuggest, as it provides nearly the same keyword tracking and site audit information that competitors like Ahrefs and SEMRush, but for free!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It’s one thing to say why a site or solution is great, but it’s another to actually walk through it. So that’s exactly what I wanted to do today.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Let’s walk through some of the great features and tools that Ubersuggest offers for free to any and all of their site visitors.</span></p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2020-07-21_17-03-13-1024x432.png alt width=525 height=221 sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><span style=font-weight:400>Ubersuggest Review – All in One SEO Tool</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock, you probably already know who Neil Patel is. And <a href=#>if you follow Neil</a>, you likely already know about Ubersuggest. If not, it’s an all in one SEO tool that makes keyword tracking and competitor analysis super easy, and best of all… free!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Through the use of Ubersuggest, anyone can visit the site and type in their site URL or preferred keyword. Without the need for registration, the platform will instantly shoot out a data report like the one below.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As you will see, it looks just like the dashboard area for many of the leading SEO tools and tracking solutions. Easy to read, navigate and understand… even for newbie site owners and bloggers.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, this is just a quick introduction to what Ubersuggest has to offer. Let’s now take a look at some of the quick and easy SEO and tracking tools offered by the site.</span></p><h2><span style=font-weight:400>Ubersuggest Keyword Ideas</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Right now, we are living in a world of content overload. There are currently now more than a billion websites and blogs that are actively creating new content all the time. Throw in the massive content being created by a billion YouTube members and another few billion users on social media, and you are pretty much well beyond content overload.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>With this in mind, content creation and ranking in Google is still one of the most sought after and competitive ways to get free traffic to your site. This means content creation is still a must, but you also need to be smart about it.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Instead of spending hours of your valuable time on writing new content and publishing it to your site, more time should be spent on the SEO and keyword research process. As much as we would all like to rank for generic and big money keywords, it’s just not going to happen.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For times like these, this is where the </span><span style=font-weight:400>Ubersuggest Keyword Ideas tool</span><span style=font-weight:400> comes in handy.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>A good example of this would be if you had a blog and wanted to write about “instagram influencers” and ideally rank for this term. By first plugging that phrase into Ubersuggest we can see the following.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2020-07-21_12-39-52-1024x521.png alt width=525 height=267 sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Ubersuggest is great because it quickly provides all of this useful information and stats for free, but also because of the way it breaks it down.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On the left side, we can see a set of keywords that are relevant to the original phrase we put in. In this area it also shows the search volume, cost per click average and difficulty scores.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On the right side, you have a breakdown showing the sites already ranking for this term and giving you an idea of what it would take in order to outrank these sites. This is quickly summarized by the Neil Patel reference at the top that says “</span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The average web page that ranks in the top 10 has 29 backlinks and a domain score of 84.</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>”</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2020-07-21_16-37-06.png alt width=687 height=181 sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For any site owner or brand that is serious about ranking at the top of Google for their desired keywords and phrases, this type of search tool and data is an absolute must. For even deeper analysis on the many different directions you can go with this data, the </span><span style=font-weight:400>Content Ideas tool</span><span style=font-weight:400> will grab your keyword data and profile you with a list of relevant top ranking articles.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>All of this data can be pulled up for free when visiting the site, or stored for future reference when you create a profile and connect to your Google Search Console account.</span></p><h2><span style=font-weight:400>Improve Site Rankings with a Full Site Audit</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>As mentioned earlier, it’s getting harder and harder to rank at the top of Google. While methods like content creation and link building work best, you still need to work on the foundation and incoming/outgoing links to your site as well.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For this, it would be ideal to </span><span style=font-weight:400>run a full site audit</span><span style=font-weight:400> through Ubersuggest. You can see a preview of what this would look like in the screenshot below.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Again, this is free to all users who access the site. If you have a larger site or are looking for as much information as possible, it’s recommended to go with one of the premium monthly plans so you can track all data and your progress month after month.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2020-07-21_16-45-49-1024x641.png alt width=525 height=329 sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>After running a site audit, Ubersuggest will provide you with a number of stats and related information based on your site’s power, rankings and health. Such elements include an On-Page SEO Score, Organic Monthly Traffic, Organic Keywords and the Number of Backlinks.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>All of these data points are quite useful and cool to see, but the Health Check on your site is where the audit really provides value. These will be in the form of Critical Errors, Warnings and Recommendations, which should all be attended to and then refreshed to make sure you make your way through all of the requested changes.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As each of these tasks are completed, your site score will improve and search ranking improvements usually follow. Again, with a profile in place, you will be able to continually run new audits on your site to make sure they are always performing in the best possible way.</span></p><h2><span style=font-weight:400>Is Ubersuggest Really Free?</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Throughout this review article, I’ve been referencing that Ubersuggest is free. I’m sure most of you are thinking there’s a catch or that there is some free trial and upsell associated with it.</span></p><p><b><i>Getting right to the point, it’s free.</i></b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>If you were to visit the site and wanted to start using the tools and tracking reports we featured above, they are all free to access. Some may come with data limitations, but the option is always there to create a free account where you can connect to your Google Console, which will allow site owners to log in and track the growth and rankings of their site.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For users with multiple sites or looking to dive into even deeper statistics and data, there are premium plans catered to the needs of larger site owners, business and brands or SEO agencies. These paid plans start at $29 a month and offer more analytical data, project reports and user access, while also coming with a free 7-day trial.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/seo-tools-costs.png alt width=640 height=272 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As you will see from the comparison chart above, Ubersuggest is just a fraction of the cost in comparison to what other well-known SEO tools are charging.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>How to Rank Higher with Ubersuggest</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now that you’ve seen what’s possible with Ubersuggest, it’s time to start using the site and it’s powerful set of tools to your advantage.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This is as simple as visiting </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> or typing in “ubersuggest” into Google. Once you get to the site, enter your site url or preferred keywords. Ubersuggest will do the rest for you.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Then it’s up to you to decide if you are good with visiting the site whenever you want to look up some quick data, or creating an account to track and monitor your site’s rankings and growth over time.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Either way, the ease of use and powerful tools offered by Neil’s latest project is sure to provide site owners on a budget with everything they’ve always hoped for, while also not having to re-invest a ton of money in the process.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Be sure to check it out and see how you can start improving your site rankings today.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiykZi3sLTNrKanZpOkunC6xKKjZqiRqbKtedSbnKurpZy0pr%2FTZqmerpmaxHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-grey-net-worth-how-much-is-jennifer-grey-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Grey Net Worth: How Much is Jennifer Grey Worth?</span></a>
