Nordstrom. The company started in 1901 as a shoe store. He started working for the company at age 9 and that time, he was earning 25 cents per hour of work.</p><p>In over four decades, the company which started with only seven shoe stores developed into a&nbsp;European chain of boutiques and 156 stores found in 27 states. Under his leadership, the company's value significantly grew from $40 million to a staggering $8.6 billion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1963, he started working as the company's president. By 1968, he became the co-chairman along with Bob Bender, Jack McMillan, James and John. He retired from his post in 1995. The leadership of the company was restructured by his sons together with the new chief executive officer John Whitacre. During his absence, the company earned significant losses which triggered Bruce to resume his post in 2000. Upon his return, profitability began to occur. Six years later, he tendered his resignation again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BvsdOwpqusmGSwprjEm6mirKlir7a%2FyKecrKtforKve8GrrJydXaO8s7DSramopV2jsrV51qipraBf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./you-costars-victoria-pedretti-and-dylan-arnold-are-dating.html><span>←</span><span>'You' Costars Victoria Pedretti and Dylan Arnold Are Dating</span></a>
