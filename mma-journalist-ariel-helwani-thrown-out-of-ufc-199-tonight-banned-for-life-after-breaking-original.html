Ariel is a respected journalist, and even if he weren’t, this isn’t okay. The Lesnar story was massive. He did his job. Any journalist in the UFC or WWE field, if given that info, would have been stupid not to run with it. It&nbsp;enrages me to see a company like UFC treating a passionate&nbsp;fan and dedicated reporter&nbsp;this way. It shows a complete lack of understanding (or total apathy, perhaps?) for journalism. I am supremely disappointed.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwg5BuaWppXaK6onnJqKyrppGhtrTAjJqpop2cYrWmuNaapaJlpJ2%2FsMPNZqaurF2ks27BxZxkanFpYsGwusign61lkpa7r7HDZp2oql2htqexjJqdrZ2iYq%2BzscCkoKefXaS%2FqrPIp5ilZZKnvKS3jKWcrKaRp3q0wM6rsA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kristina-tholstrup-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Kristina Tholstrup Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
