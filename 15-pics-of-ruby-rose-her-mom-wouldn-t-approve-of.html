People were mesmerized by her pouty lips, gender-fluidity look, and all those sexy tattoos. She’s not like most girls, and she proves that in her acting and real life. She has both men and women dropping to their knees just to be near her. She may have made her big splash on Orange is the New Black, but she’s been around for a while. She's a Jack of all trades, dabbling in many roles, such as fashion designer, actress, model, and even TV personality. We aren’t sure where this girl came from, but we're sure glad she arrived. We look forward to seeing where she’s going to go and what she's going to do next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She’s made a name for herself in Hollywood as a girl who likes to break boundaries. She doesn’t excuse herself or apologize for who she is. She's making an impression, and she doesn’t care what anyone thinks about it. Whether you have a thing for tattoos or not, you're sure to love these Ruby Rose photos. Not only has she proven that she's an unconventional beauty, but she does it with a badass attitude. She lives her life as if it’s her last day and takes no prisoners. Check out these 15 insanely hot photos of Ruby Rose!</p><h2 id=artist-love><strong>Artist Love</strong></h2><p>Maybe she's taking after her artist mom in this free-spirited photo. Actually, it’s a snap from the video Break Free, which can be viewed on YouTube. There's nothing better than watching a girl pour water all over her naked body. It’s a candid shot of Rose in the video, and it tells us everything we ever wanted to know about the actress. “The person I am every single day is the person that's growing and getting better. The more people look up to me, the more important it is to be concise with what message I want to leave. That's where I feel like I'm a role model. Maybe not to everyone, but for a lot of minorities, I am, and I kinda love that -- the role model for the underdog.” Everyone just loves rooting for the underdog.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bubble-bath><strong>Bubble Bath</strong></h2><p>Who doesn’t love a girl in a bubble bath? Ruby Rose is taking a moment from her busy life to luxuriate in a bath. Even while taking a bath, she looks badass, and her pouty lips are just to die for. We can’t get enough of this girl. Ruby Rose got into acting because modeling wasn’t really working out for her. She lost a lot of modeling gigs because they just didn’t get the “tough” look that she was portraying. Being gorgeous apparently isn’t enough to be a model. “I started off as an Australian model. I had so many knockbacks, having short hair and being rejected, and I always thought: I'm never gonna get to where I want to get unless I start looking more feminine.” So, instead of changing who she was, she decided to change her career instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=just-a-kiss><strong>Just a Kiss</strong></h2><p>Whoa!! Down boys! We know that this is probably every guy's fantasy, but let’s just reign it in for a minute. Ruby Rose takes us back to another famous actress. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie</a> looks very similar to Rose and used to behave in the same manner. She would storm the streets of Hollywood saying and doing whatever she wanted. She caused controversy just like Rose is doing by kissing boys and girls; she even gave her brother an open-mouthed kiss on the red carpet. Rose isn’t the first girl to hit Hollywood ready to make some waves. The reason why people like these girls so much is because they don’t follow the rules. They live their lives just the way that they want to. “Never say no to anything, whatever the universe brings me. I've always lived by that.” We could all learn a lot from that message.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sad-days><strong>Sad Days</strong></h2><p>We all have those sad days when we just want to stay in bed and flip through old magazines. Interesting cover, though, for this Rolling Stones girl. Those are her costars from Orange is the New Black, and maybe she’s missing all that girl time. Lying in bed with a pouty lip, Rose just can’t seem to ever look bad. When she was growing up, she had a famous imaginary friend. Don’t judge, you know you had one, too! “Growing up, I had a very vivid imagination, and Leonardo was like my best imaginary friend that I spoke to. When things were tough, or I was scared in an unsafe environment, I always imagined that the Ninja Turtles would come to the rescue.” Hell, we’re sure that we would all love for a Ninja Turtle to come and rescue us, too.</p><h2 id=cosmetics><strong>Cosmetics</strong></h2><p>Ruby Rose posted this on Instagram; it’s a photo from a shoot she did with Urban Decay Cosmetics. It’s sexy as hell and has the tattooed model looking sizzling in the rain. You may think that she came out of nowhere, but Rose carries around a pretty famous namesake. She could have ridden in on her namesake alone, but she decided to make a name for herself first. You might not be aware that she's the goddaughter of Lionel Rose, a famous boxer. She's also the great-granddaughter of Alec Campbell, who fought in the Australian Battle of Gallipoli during World War I. He was one of the last surviving soldiers of that war. “You don't wake up at 18 and necessarily become the person you want to be as an adult -- you have to work hard to become them.” Preach, Rose!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beach-body><strong>Beach Body</strong></h2><p>We can see every bit of Rose’s incredible body as she heads off for a day at the beach. The girl spends a lot of time in the gym, and we can see that it’s worked wonders for her figure. Having boxers in the family probably doesn’t hurt either. Wearing a bikini top and shorts, Rose has never looked better. What we like most about Rose is that she doesn’t try to fit into the stereotypes of what a woman is supposed to act like and dress like. “I feel like my style is very much androgynous. It's rock, chic, like casual wear, but then on the flip side to that, being that it's so androgynous, it'll either be skinny jeans and a leather jacket, or if I'm doing a red carpet or event, I'll completely flip that and be wearing a suit or a dress.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=old-modeling-days><strong>Old Modeling Days</strong></h2><p>It might be hard to believe, but this was Ruby Rose when she first started modeling. She looks so different with long hair, but she’s as gorgeous as ever. She's truly channeling Jolie with those gorgeous lips of hers. She's a stunner whether her hair is short or not. These days, Rose is calling herself “genderfluid” because she doesn’t identify with just one gender. She wants it all, and she has no problem getting whatever she wants. “I feel like I'm a boy, but I don't feel like I should've been born with different parts of my body or anything like that. I feel like it's just all in how I dress and how I talk and how I look and feel, and that makes me happy.” We've certainly enjoyed her character on Orange is the New Black.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=model-style><strong>Model Style</strong></h2><p>Posing for GQ, Rose is nothing short of smoldering in this photo. Wearing barely anything at all with some thigh-high boots, Rose is sizzling in this photo. She's baring it all and looks hot as hell. Many people assume that her name is a made-up pen name for her career, but it’s actually the name that she was born with. It’s not surprising since her mother, Katia Langenheim, was an artist. “My mom is a painter and an artist. She would play music, and she always had very good taste in music, fashion, and art. She was also a young single mom, so I think she had really good style; she was really free... just really inspiring in her own way and allowed me to find the direction I wanted to take in my life.” We can’t help but love that artistic touch.</p><h2 id=just-one-look><strong>Just One Look</strong></h2><p>We're pretty sure that she could start a fire with a look like this. With just one look, she draws us in, and we never want to let her go. In this modeling pose, she's casually sitting by the pool, but we can all feel the heat around her. She looks amazing in her bikini and showing off all her cool tattoos. She’s the type of girl who stands up for others no matter what. “I wanted to represent minorities in the respect of people who had been bullied in school or people who were gay or lesbian or trans or people who aren't blonde haired and blue-eyed. I have short hair, and I am covered in tattoos. I like showing people that it's within their rights to be different.” We all strive to be better people, and maybe we can learn something from her anti-bullying movement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rock-star-pose><strong>Rock Star Pose</strong></h2><p>We're sure that her artist mom must have had something to do with this photo. Rose is all about being edgy, and this might be her edgiest look yet. She's laid out in a sexy outfit covered in graffiti paint. Her makeup is dark, and we kind of have a feeling that she might look super hot with pink hair. Rose always speaks about how she feels blessed in the life that she leads. She never says no to anything that the Universe throws her way, and that’s probably a really great way to live. Take each opportunity that comes your way. “I got to host a radio show. I got a clothing range. I was the face of fashion week. I got to do a whole television show with kids.” It’s like ticking things off of your bucket list; you only live once, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=just-one-day-in-the-life><strong>Just One Day in the Life…</strong></h2><p>This is just a snap from a vacation that Rose took, and I think we just need to take a moment to appreciate her rock-hard body. She looks killer getting out of the water with her wet body and all those sexy tattoos. We're a huge fan of black-and-white photos, and this is a great snap of Rose and that megawatt smile of hers. She couldn’t have looked any happier with her life than she does in this photo. “I think at one point I had 50 or 60 tattoos, but then they all morphed to become a half sleeve and then a full sleeve and then a sleeve with half my hand and then half my back. So, I have so many now where I feel like I can get away with saying, 'I have three tattoos.'”</p><h2 id=bad-attitude><strong>Bad Attitude</strong></h2><p>We just love her bad attitude; it’s part of her charm. With this Instagram post, she's showing off her edgy attitude as well as those sexy lips. Her hair is messy, but she's never looked sexier. She was once engaged to the fashion designer Phoebe, daughter of famous author Roald Dahl. They were engaged for 20 months before they broke up. There were rumors going around that Phoebe cheated on the actress. Regardless of what’s going on in her life, she believes in being true to herself. “All I've wanted to be is someone people look up to. It's funny -- everyone says I'm controversial. I've never worked out what it is about me that's controversial. I've never had a DUI; I've never been in a brawl; you've never seen photos of me walking out of clubs at 5 A.M.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=edgy-style><strong>Edgy Style</strong></h2><p>What more could you ask for in a photo than to see Rose in a bra and biting down on a knife? It’s definitely an unusual photo shoot, but there’s certainly something appealing to the whole look. This vintage black-and-white photo is incredibly edgy and cool. She's received a lot of flak for going from a “girly” girl to dressing like a boy all the time. But she doesn’t seem to care. She wants to dress in what makes her feel good instead of following society’s rules. “My mum used to wear the guys' Chesty Bonds tanks, and I used to end up wearing them after she'd finish with them. She's a painter, and they would be covered in paint splatters. She would wear them and wear them until they were super-soft, and then I'd get them. But I was just a kid, so they were like a dress on me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fighter-girl><strong>Fighter Girl</strong></h2><p>She looks tough in this photo, and that’s part of what makes her so insanely hot. She's done some amateur boxing; after all, her godfather is a retired boxer. Her fighter name was Ruby “The Thorn” Rose, which has a catchy ring to it. She's sporting blonde hair in this photo and is channeling her inner fighter. “Her character Stella is an inmate 'whose sarcastic sense of humor and captivating looks quickly draw the attention of some of Litchfield’s inmates.' Speaking of her character, Ruby said, 'She’s cocky, she’s flirty and she’s super funny… This is the sexiest season by far.’” (Uselessdaily) There's a reason why Rose is so popular on the show, and it’s because she goes against conventions in all aspects of her life. There are just as many girls that have the hots for her as there are guys. “I have a lot of characteristics that would normally be present in a guy and then less that would be present in a woman.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-dj-life><strong>The DJ Life</strong></h2><p>There’s more proof that the girl can do it all. She's been found on occasion DJ’ing for events and celebrity parties. She does it all the time for her friends. She has a love for music that goes far and wide. Like we said before, she's a true Jack of all trades. She's all about making a difference in the world. Sometimes, making a difference means you have to put yourself out there, and Rose does that easily. “Being honest about being bullied in school and my bipolar was not so much of a 'do I or don't I?'; it was waiting for the right time. Even before I knew what making a mark on the world meant, I knew I wanted to make a difference.” She speaks about her own struggles in the hopes that it will help someone else.</p><p><strong>Sources:&nbsp;rebelcircus.com;&nbsp;uselessdaily.com</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2ltqS%2FjKidZqqll8Zuvs6snGaglad6rrvMZq6orZyZu7V5wKmnq6emmnqwso4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-celebrity-guests-who-ve-been-banned-from-snl.html><span>←</span><span>15 Celebrity Guests Who've Been Banned From SNL</span></a>
