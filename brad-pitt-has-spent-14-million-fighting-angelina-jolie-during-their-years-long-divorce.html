"Angelina doesn't want to let her fight for sole custody go, but the children are growing up, and even they tell their mom it's time to stop," <a href=#>a source told Radar Online</a> in June.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The source said that the kids are “fine” with seeing Brad. “Maybe with the exception of Maddox, they all actually like him,” they went on.</p><p>After more than a decade together, Brad and Angelina split up in 2016 following an incident on a private jet. Angelina alleged that brad got physically aggressive with her and their children, leading her to leave him. The FBI later launched an investigation into the plane incident, only to clear Brad within a few weeks.</p><p>The exes were <a href=#>declared legally single in 2019</a>, but their divorce has yet to be finalized, as they continue to try to sort out custody of their minor children as well as divide their assets. And given the most recent reports, it looks like the divorce ay be carried out for much longer, if Angelina gets her way.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Noah Cyrus Engaged To Pinkus With $600,000 Ring After 2 Month Romance</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>News Nation Now</a>, <a href=#>NYP</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvs63DZqeirKRitaK%2FjKynnqakYn51ecyio6Whn6N6p7XGoauippdirq%2BzxKWgp5ldn7yttcRmm66qmaO0bsDHnqCrZamarrO%2FjKWmp59dmba3u9GcnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amanda-bynes-father-says-actress-was-not-intoxicated-when-arrested.html><span>←</span><span>Amanda Bynes Father Says Actress Was Not Intoxicated When Arrested</span></a>
