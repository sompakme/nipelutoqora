However, when some fresh superhero media takes off, fans are treated to something special like The Boys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The series has had two hit seasons, and fans are itching for more. <a href=#>The show has had some amazing episodes</a>, and while <a href=#>not much is known about it yet</a>, the early buzz is that <a href=#>season three is going to be insane</a>.</p><p>Karl Urban has been brilliant on the show, and for many, this is his best role yet. He was plenty busy before landing on The Boys, and we want to take a deeper dive on the performer.</p><h2 id=karl-urban-stars-on-39-the-boys-39>Karl Urban Stars On 'The Boys'</h2><p>The superhero market is a crowded one, meaning that it takes something genuinely unique to leave an impression on fans, especially without the benefit of being directly attached to Marvel or DC. So, when a show like The Boys comes along, it turns into a pretty big deal for superhero fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The series debuted in 2019, and it didn't take long for people to see that this was no ordinary superhero show. It pulls no punches, is not afraid to get its hands dirty, and will absolutely floor audiences with its willingness to be over-the-top.</p><p>On the series, Karl Urban has been fantastic as Butcher, and he has played a part in the show becoming such a success on Amazon Prime.</p><p>When talking about the show turning into a hit with the fans, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Urban said</a>, "And, at the end of the day, ultimately it feels satisfying and rewarding to know that what we have labored on so intensively for so long is so greatly appreciated, and we love it. We just feel like we have the best fans, and we’re so grateful for that."</p><p>Urban has truly shined on The Boys, but he had a lot going on before he snagged the role of Butcher on the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Erin Moriarty Really Feels About Her 'Boys' Castmates</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=karl-urban-been-in-the-mcu-and-39-lord-of-the-rings-39>Karl Urban Been In The MCU And 'Lord Of The Rings'</h2><p>In the world of film, Karl Urban has had far more experience and success than the vast majority of people realize.</p><p>It's often said that getting a role in a film franchise is a big deal, but doing so multiple times is legitimately rare. Turns out, Karl Urban has appeared in several huge franchises during his career in entertainment.</p><p>Things really kicked into high gear when he was cast as Eomer in the Lord of the Rings franchise. For many, this was their introduction to the actor, and things would continue to get better from there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Urban also got to play Kirill in the Bourne franchise, Siberius in the Riddick franchise, Leonard McCoy in the Star Trek franchise, and Skurge in the MCU. Lest we forget his cameo as a stormtrooper in the Star Wars franchise, as well.</p><p>It is unreal to think that one person has appeared in so many film franchises, but it just goes to show how great of a talent Urban is.</p><p>Urban primarily focused on films earlier in his career, but this does not mean that he completely stayed away from the small screen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is 'The Boys' Actor Antony Starr's Girlfriend?</a></span></p><h2 id=karl-urban-been-on-shows-like-39-almost-human-39>Karl Urban Been On Shows Like 'Almost Human'</h2><p>During the 1990s, Karl Urban was getting some solid time on television. He appeared on shows like Hercules and Xena, and he would take an extended break from TV before getting some more experience later on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Arguably his most notable TV role came on Almost Human, which lasted for 13 episodes.</p><p>The actor was drawn to the show's lead character, and he open up about this in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>.</p><p>"I was really drawn to this because here’s a character who wakes up from being in a coma for two years to discover that the previous year of his life was a complete fraud. The woman that he thought he was madly in love with was actually planted by a criminal organization, and as a result of that weakness, 11 men were killing, including his best friend and partner," said Urban.</p><p>Eventually, the actor would have another lengthy break from the small screen before landing the role of Butcher on The Boys. He definitely turned in solid performances on other shows earlier in his career, but what he has done on his hit superhero series has really taken things to another level.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is 'The Boys' Actor Antony Starr The Most Hated Superhero On The Internet?</a></span></p><p>The Boys is gearing up for season three on the small screen, and fans cannot wait to see Urban and the gang back in action.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'The Boys': Here's Why Antony Starr Wanted To Turn Down Homelander</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60ecqaqaVlpaevorqMm5yfp6KaerW0xGaZqLGjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sonny-bill-williams-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Sonny Bill Williams Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
