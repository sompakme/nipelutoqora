He has maintained this claim for several years through his Facebook posts and interviews.

His battle even extended to the Australian High Court, where he has sought legal avenues to support his claims and seek recognition from his royal parents.</p><h2 id=simon-charles-dorante-day-claims-he-is-the-biological-son-of-king-charles-iii-and-camilla-parker-bowles>Simon Charles Dorante-Day Claims He Is The Biological Son Of King Charles III And Camilla Parker Bowles</h2><p>Simon Charles Dorante-Day was born on April 5, 1966, in Gosport, Portsmouth, UK. He lives and works as an engineer in Queensland Australia. Dorante-Day shares nine children with his wife, Dr. Elvianna Dorante-Day.</p><p>Dorante-Day attracted attention when he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">presented a series of claims and documents supporting his belief that he is the biological child of King Charles III and Queen Consort Camilla Parker Bowles.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dorante-Day claims that when he was eight months old, he was adopted by a local couple named Karen and David Day. Interestingly, his adoptive grandparents, Winifred and Ernest Bowlden, had served in one of the royal households of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, where his grandfather even received an Imperial Service Award.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Will-Prince-Charles’-Stepchildren-With-Camilla-Get-Titles-When-He-Becomes-King.jpg><p>According to Dorante-Day, his grandmother repeatedly told him that he was the offspring of King Charles III and Parker Bowles. "She didn't just hint at it, she told me outright," he said during his interview with 7Life.</p><p>Based on his research, Dorante-Day discovered that King Charles and Queen Consort developed a close relationship in 1965. He alleges that shortly thereafter, as his birth approached, Parker Bowles vanished from the British social scene for around nine months, while King Charles was sent to Australia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A historian also raised doubts about the hospital listed on Dorante-Day's birth certificate, claiming that it did not deliver a single baby during the entire decade in which he was born. There are also suspicions surrounding the names listed as his parents on the birth certificate, suggesting that they may be fictitious.</p><p>Dorante-Day asserts that Parker Bowles kept him hidden until he reached eight months old, taking advantage of the royal family's influence and protection to maintain his secrecy.</p><h2 id=simon-charles-dorante-day-never-meant-for-his-parentage-pursuit-to-go-public>Simon Charles Dorante-Day Never Meant For His Parentage Pursuit To Go Public</h2><p>In his Facebook posts, Simon Charles Dorante-Day shares information about his ongoing quest for acknowledgment from King Charles III and Parker Bowles.</p><p>According to one of his posts, the British Metropolitan Police initiated Operation Paget in 2004 to investigate various conspiracy theories surrounding the tragic death of Princess Diana. This inquiry inadvertently brought attention to Dorante-Day's story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template-1-8.jpg><p>Dorante-Day admitted that he initially tried to keep his battle for recognition private. However, after his story became known during the Paget Inquiry, it was leaked to the public. Since then, he and his family have had to navigate the public's attention while striving to maintain a semblance of a normal life.</p><p>Addressing critics who accused him of seeking financial gain through his claims, Dorante-Day firmly stated that his pursuit holds no monetary motivation. "There's no money in this. You try being a love child, It. It's not very profitable," he said. "And nor should it. It's about honesty and the truth."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Prince Harry Reportedly Avenges Princess Diana’s Death By Taking Aim At All Royals Who Wronged Her</a></span></p><p>He explained that his attempts to find answers began long before he made his claims public. "We tried to get answers for years before we went public. We have written to Charles, we've written to Camilla, we've written to the Queen, we've written, we've written and we've written… I've been mocked over my conversations with Buckingham Palace, but it's for real."</p><h2 id=simon-charles-dorante-day-demands-dna-samples-from-king-charles-iii-and-camilla-parker-bowles>Simon Charles Dorante-Day Demands DNA Samples From King Charles III And Camilla Parker Bowles</h2><p>According to a report by Seven News, Simon Dorante-Day did not watch the <a href=#>$100 million coronation ceremony of King Charles III</a> and Queen Consort Camilla Parker Bowles. However, despite dismissing the ceremony, Dorante-Day remains unwavering in his claims of being a royal love child, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he even wrote an open letter to his alleged biological parents before their coronation.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template-2-7.jpg><p>Dorante-Day expressed his views on King Charles' ascension, emphasizing his belief that a monarch should be held accountable to the law. "... the fact that I'm still seeking answers in my case is a bit of a bug for his coronation because I'm not going to stop. Him being King doesn't make me any less his son, does it? I'm going to be pursuing what I'm pursuing. I have my proof of where I stand with this."</p><p>Dorante-Day revealed his intention to initiate his next legal battle, aiming to obtain DNA tests from the royal couple. Dorante-Day has been seeking a paternity test from King Charles III and the Queen Consort for nearly a decade. He also expressed his plans to include Prince William and Prince Harry in the DNA testing, as public speculation about <a href=#>Prince Harry's paternity was once questioned by the royal family.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Compelling DNA paternity tests from William and Harry have always been part of the overall plan. There's already plenty of public conjecture over the paternity of both of them as it is, might as well resolve it once and for all…"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth's Low-Key Coronation Concert Was Far Tamer Than King Charles'</a></span></p><p>Dorante-Day firmly believes that DNA testing will provide conclusive answers regarding his paternity, pointing out visual differences between himself and the royal brothers that have been observed by many. Additionally, he hopes the DNA test will uncover others who were aware of the situation and played a part in a larger scheme.</p><p>"I'll be back to the Family Court. In his final ruling last time I was before the courts, the judge told me that if I come back with the evidence all nice and neatly stamped, then there's no reason to deny an application for a DNA test, and Charles and Camilla will have to answer that." Dorante-Day shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqaXYrCprdGlnKxlkaOxbq%2FApqClpJFivaK%2Byp6pZpqfrLmmv4yio6Wdl57BqrnArZxmmpmkubCzyJyYpWWjpLtuv8impqdlk52us7jErGSdp6KWu7WxjJ2YsmWiqrqwvoytqa6smGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-clarkson-gives-an-inside-look-at-her-montana-ranch.html><span>←</span><span>Kelly Clarkson Gives an Inside Look at Her Montana Ranch</span></a>
