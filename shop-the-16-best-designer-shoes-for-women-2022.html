Our favorite fictional fashionista is the queen of the luxury high heel! In the SATC movie, Mr. Big even proposes to Carrie by slipping on a bejeweled Manolo Blahnik pump! Talk about a Cinderella moment.</p><p>When it comes to narrowing down the best designer shoes for women, we couldn’t help but wonder… What would Carrie Bradshaw do? She said it best herself: “When one door closes, a shoe box opens.” Don’t walk through life waiting for the other shoe to drop. Kick up your heels and be footloose and fancy-free! (We’ll cool it on the shoe puns, promise.)</p><p>While we don’t have the budget to exclusively fill our closet with designer shoes, we do believe it’s worth it to invest in a few pairs of high-quality footwear. It’s not just about the luxury label — designer shoes are made with premium materials, which lead to a longer shelf life. There’s a reason we often have to replace cheaper styles season after season! Plus, we reserve our designer heels for special events.</p><h2><strong>How We Chose the Best Designer Shoes for Women</strong></h2><p>Truth be told, I tend to buy less inexpensive shoes, while my twin sister Brooke opts for pricier pairs. So, I consulted with my fraternal footwear expert for her recommendations. I also made sure to include a mix of classic staples that will go with everything, as well as fun, trendy styles that will stand out in a crowd. Some heels, some boots, some flats. And, as always, I tried to find pieces that are comfortable and (relatively) affordable. If the shoe fits, wear it!</p><p><span>From glamorous pumps, to stylish boots and casual sneakers, you’re going to be obsessed with these designer shoes. </span>Fall head over heels for these high-end styles which would all make Carrie Bradshaw proud!</p><h2><strong>1.
