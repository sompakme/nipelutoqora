She kicked off by starting with the entryway, which featured a wreath that she received as a Christmas <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> from fellow <a href=#>The Voice</a> judge <a href=#><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong></a>.</p><p>“This is our cabin and it’s super cute and cozy,” Clarkson said, before pointing at different areas of the quaint home. “This is where <a href=#>[my kids] Remi and River</a> sleep on little bunks, there’s [where] <a href=#>me and [my husband] <strong>Brandon</strong> [<strong>Blackstock</strong>]</a> sleep and then there’s where Seth, our 13-year-old, sleeps. It can also be another bunk, but our 18-year-old [<strong>Savannah Blackstock</strong>] usually isn’t with us.”</p><p>“Anyway, it’s kinda cute! This is where we hang out,” the “Love So Soft” singer continued. She also panned over a poster of <a href=#><strong>Dolly Parton</strong></a> hanging in the kitchen, and she noted that the home is filled with “games and puzzles” to keep her children entertained.</p><p>One week prior, Clarkson <a href=#>gave a more in-depth look</a> at her Montana home on her daytime talk show. At the time, she explained <a href=#>why she and Brandon, 43, love visiting the ranch</a> when they get the chance.</p><p>“We officially bought our ranch, Vintage Valley, over a year-and-a-half ago. I just love being outdoors,” she explained on March 31. “Brandon and I love wide open spaces and coming to the ranch because, well, both of us grew up in the countryside, one. And two, we literally work almost seven days a week if not seven days a week. So, you know, when we have time off, we really like to check out and it’s nice to get into nature.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Clarkson continued, “As a society, we don’t do it enough. We’re always working constantly, so it’s nice to just come out here and sit by the stream and hear the water flowing and be around all the trees. I just love the sound of just nature and not cars and people on top of each other.”</p><p>Scroll down below to see photos of Clarkson’s Montana ranch!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKa4y7JknKSRp7i0u81mnqKulah6orqMoqWsoZSaeq27zqRkmqxdnbKzecyopa2ZnpZ6s63NnJ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-contact-amazon-for-a-refund.html><span>←</span><span>How to contact amazon for a refund</span></a>
