Miller’s Tuscaloosa attorney, Jim Standridge, released a statement.</p><p>Acknowledging Miller’s proximity to the crime, but maintained that Miller did not own or use a weapon and was unaware of any plans involving weapons. Miller cooperated with the investigation and provided the police with complete assistance.</p><p>Despite the incident, according to ESPN and the athletic director at Alabama, Miller is expected to play in a game between the Crimson Tide and South Carolina. He currently leads the team with an average of 18.7 points per game this season.</p><p>Tragically, the encounter on the Strip resulted in the loss of life and injuries to others. Investigating and holding accountable those who may have been involved in such violence is important.</p><p>At the same time, it is also essential to ensure that due process is followed and that those who are innocent are not unfairly accused or punished.</p><p>It is unclear from the statement whether Miller knew that Miles intended to use the gun or was aware of any potential violence.</p><p>It is also unclear whether Miller could have prevented the tragedy from occurring. Nevertheless, it is important to consider the facts and evidence in this case and to ensure that justice is served.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdl7%2BiusOopWalmaG5pr7SZqOar6mav262yKZkrKyRo7GztcOgnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-american-humorist-greg-gutfeld-his-net-worth-family.html><span>←</span><span>Who is American Humorist Greg Gutfeld?
