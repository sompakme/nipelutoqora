Whether you love him the most when he's partnered up with Seth Rogen, as the Green Goblin, or fighting in a war flick, it's safe to say this actor has quite the roster of movies. While you probably have your favs, we definitely know that not all of this man's flicks have done super well.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Weird Things Only James Franco Can Pull Off</a></span></p><p>So, when you're looking for your next James Franco binge, we've made a list of some that didn't go great at the box office. Some may be hidden gems, and others you may just simply want to avoid. Here are James Franco's 10 lowest-grossing movies, based on Domestic Gross and according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Box Office Mojo</a>.</p><h2 id=goat-2016---23-020>Goat (2016) - $23,020</h2><p>This movie is neither a hidden gem nor a high-grossing flick. However, this flick does star a few heartthrobs, including <a href=#>Nick Jonas</a>, Ben Schnetzer, and Gus Halper. Of course, our wonderful James also has a large role in the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This a college flick with a fraternity, and you can find some brother love and hate in the midst. Clearly, $23,000 isn't much to brag about, but we're pretty sure this movie got a small release. However, it's kind of a fun flick if you want to watch some brotherly struggle, toxic masculinity, and these heartthrobs on the big screen.</p><h2 id=the-dead-girl-2006---19-875>The Dead Girl (2006) - $19,875</h2><p>This crime drama mystery clearly didn't peak too many people's interests. A woman's death leads to clues that begin to intersect the lives of seemingly totally unrelated people. Of course, this film didn't prove to be a great source of revenue, and you've probably never heard of it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Times Nick Jonas & Priyanka Chopra Were Relationship Goals</a></span></p><p>However, it does star Toni Collette, Brittany Murphy, Marcia Gay Harden, Rose Byrne, and of course, James Franco. Clearly, this cast wasn't enough to break the bank. At the very least, this mystery is kind of intriguing and has a decent cast.</p><h2 id=as-i-lay-dying-2013---16-697>As I Lay Dying (2013) - $16,697</h2><p>This is a film adaptation of William Faulkner's <a href=#>novel</a>. James has taken a role in a couple of these, but honestly, none of them did super well with the critics or at the box office. This is a heartfelt story about a family in the 1930s, but clearly James Franco's name alongside the brilliant mind of William Faulkner wasn't enough to bring in some dough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plus, this movie kind of bombed. We'd suggest the other Faulkner adaptations, but they didn't do so hot, either.</p><h2 id=yosemite-2015---13-931>Yosemite (2015) - $13,931</h2><p>This drama takes place in 1985 and follows the intertwining stories of three middle school friends. In a small community in Palo Alto, their friendship is tested when a mountain lion looms in the area. Yeah, it sounds interesting, but it actually scored pretty bad on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, and only brought in about $14,000 domestically.</p><p>We love James Franco, and he takes the lead in this one, but clearly it wasn't intriguing enough. At the very least, this movie is pretty stunning visually.</p><h2 id=the-adderall-diaries-2015---13-191>The Adderall Diaries (2015) - $13,191</h2><p>This crime drama thriller also has James at the forefront and tells the story of a writer who pens about the story of a missing wife and the murder trial of her husband.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Rogen and James Franco Movies: Ranked from Worst to Best</a></span></p><p>Honestly, this movie actually does sound interesting, and also has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amber Heard</a> and Ed Harris. However, it didn't do so well, and $13,000 is definitely nothing to brag about. Unfortunately, this one also isn't exactly a hidden gem.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=everything-will-be-fine-2015---9-233>Everything Will Be Fine (2015) - $9,233</h2><p>James Franco plays a writer in this one, too. Except, this time, he's driving through town and accidentally hits and kills a young child. This movie is clearly about him dealing with the trauma of the accident. Also clearly, it didn't exactly do well.</p><p>In fact, Rachel McAdams is also in this flick, but these two big-time names couldn't manage to bring in more than $9,000. We hope this was released in like, one theater. However, you don't have to twist our arms too much to watch the beautiful and brilliant Franco and McAdams together.</p><h2 id=sal-2011---6-883>Sal (2011) - $6,883</h2><p>This movie tells the story of actor Sal Mineo and his last day on Earth before his murder in 1976. Starring Val Lauren and Jim Parrack, James Franco takes a large supporting role as Milton Katselas.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Lowest-Grossing Johnny Depp Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><p>Of course, we usually expect biography dramas to do fairly well, but we're not exactly sure $7,000 at a domestic office can count as achieving that. At least it's an interesting story, but clearly the marketing and production just weren't there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-vault-2017---5-728>The Vault (2017) - $5,728</h2><p>This is a newer film and another crime mystery. This one follows two sisters who rob a bank in order to save their brother. Starring James as the lead, this movie also has Scott Haze, Taryn Manning, and Francesa Eastwood.</p><p>Honestly, it only got a 4.8/10 on IMDb, and this flick probably had a pretty small release. Those two factors are pretty good explanations for such a low-gross. However, we kind of love these badass women together, and Franco is totally giving us some pretty decent brother vibes.</p><h2 id=about-cherry-2012---3-003>About Cherry (2012) - $3,003</h2><p>This one is definitely a darker flick and might be more in line with some of Franco's more&nbsp;mature&nbsp;films. Starring Ashley Hinshaw, Heather Graham, and James Franco, this movie tells the tale of a young woman who moves to San Francisco and finds herself involved with pornography and a cocaine-addicted lawyer.</p><p>Honestly, we're surprised more people weren't lining up to see this one. However, it is Rated R and probably had a pretty small release. And yes, this film gets a bit raunchy.</p><h2 id=memoria-2015---2-242>Memoria (2015) - $2,242</h2><p>This one also takes place in Palo Alto, so clearly, it's a small world (fun fact: James was born and raised in that city). This is another biography drama that tells the story of Ivan Cohen, a young man who is unsatisfied with his friends, his crush, and his dysfunctional family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is actually an interesting tale of youth and finding one's place in the world, but it also takes the bottom spot on this list. So, whether you want to give it a go or not is up to you, but we probably suggest sticking with Franco's mainstream goodness.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Highest-Grossing Robert Pattinson Movies</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8mapJ6rXZu%2ForrCqGSlp6eawLV5xqumrKuZo7Ruuc6voJ6rXZrDpr6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./200b-man-elon-musk-claims-he-won-t-share-the-wealth-with-trump-or-biden.html><span>←</span><span>$200B Man Elon Musk Claims He Won't 'Share The Wealth' With Trump Or Biden</span></a>
