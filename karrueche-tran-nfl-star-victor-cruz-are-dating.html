They really like each other and are trying to make it work and see where it goes. They were and have been friends for a while and she was at his private birthday dinner in November,” one insider told <i>Us Weekly</i>. “They aren’t exclusive yet, but it’s definitely in the works.”</p><p>The couple were spotted holding hands while on a date in L.A. on Saturday, December 16.</p><p>Another insider told <i>Us</i>, “Victor and Karrueche have been hooking up for a long time. The timing was just never right and they were never in the same place at the same time. Now she has a lot more free time and for the time being&nbsp;so does he, so they are doing their best to make things work. She’s super into him and he’s head over heels for her. It’s adorable and she’s loving it.”</p><p>The model, 29, was involved in a tumultuous relationship with <a href=#><strong>Chris Brown</strong></a> on and off four years until March 2015, when it was revealed that Brown had fathered a child with another woman. Brown, 38, <a href=#>engaged in a social media war</a> with <strong>Soulja Boy</strong> over Tran in January, and a month later, he released a<a href=#> disturbing video</a> where he claimed to be a stalker.&nbsp;The “Loyal” singer also said in the since-deleted clip, “If I love you, bitch, ain’t nobody gonna have you. I’m gonna make you miserable.”</p><p>Tran filed legal documents in February claiming Brown threatened to kill her and alleging he had beaten her up in the past. In May, the “Pills & Automobiles” singer was served with <a href=#>a restraining order</a> at his 28th birthday party ordering him to stay away from Tran.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Former Chicago Bears wide receiver Cruz, 31, was previously engaged to <strong>Elaina Watley</strong> — but in 2015,&nbsp;the footballer <a href=#>exclusively confirmed to <i>Us Weekly</i></a>&nbsp;that reports that Watley had sent a group text to women he had been cheating on her&nbsp;with were true.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Tran and Cruz will be spending the holiday season together — but one of the sources says they will be bringing in the New Year by going away together!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaKnwqavx55kraqRo3qvsstmqq2ZomLDqq%2FTqKlmm6Kqx26wwK2gp59dmbyqusZmq6Gdmad6o7HSrWStp12irqyxjK2foqaXqHq4u9GkZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-oppenheim-news-us-weekly.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Oppenheim News - Us Weekly</span></a>
