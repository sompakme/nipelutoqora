The same goes for lots of sitcoms and TV shows. <a href=#>Kaley Cuoco actually revealed what The Big Bang Theory used to do with the extra food.</a> In addition, she would also reveal that during scenes which involved eating, Cuoco would make it a point to eat less.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"If you ever wanted to know what happens during our ‘dinner’ scenes, here are two videos that show the before and after . I always forgo lunch if I know we are shooting an eating scene like this one lol when you watch TONIGHT’s all new @bigbangtheory_cbs episode, you will know I was quite satisfied. Notice our crew cleaning up the props and throwing things away. The cast is moving on with their day. The scene is done. I’m wrapped. Time to go home."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>‘Kitchen Nightmares’ Versus ‘Hotel Hell’ – Who Was The Worst Business Owner Gordon Ramsay Ever Had To Deal With?</a></span></p><p>Cuoco would face some heat for the post, given that fans thought they just throw away the food. However, this is not the case, "FYI that food had been eaten, touched and worked with all day. We save all food and give away all uneaten leftovers at the end of shoot days."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As it turns out, Gordon Ramsay and MasterChef use the same approach.</p><h2 id=masterchef-doesn-t-waste-the-extra-food-and-instead-donates-it-to-mend>MasterChef Doesn't Waste The Extra Food And Instead Donates It To MEND</h2><p>Market Place discussed exactly what happens to the extra food on MasterChef. In truth, taking a look at that massive pantry of produce, it does seem like the show uses way too much food and surely, not a lot of it used by the aspiring home cooks.</p><p>A spokesperson for Fox issued a statement, stating that <a href=#>the show works alongside an organization called MEND</a> out of Los Angeles, which donates food, clothing and other resources to low income families in need.</p><p>“We do weekly donations with them and one large donation at the end of the season,” the spokesperson stated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>15 Surprising Secrets From The Set Of Food Network's MasterChef</a></span></p><p>Top Chef is another show that claims it does not waste any food. Whatever the dish that is being made is sure to go somewhere. “So we don’t waste that food,” said Birdsong, who was a contestant on “Top Chef: Miami.” “If they have to make 10 plates, they’re going to 10 diners.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It should not come as a surprise that Gordon Ramsay is thinking towards donation. The chef is always keen on giving back, especially given his tough upbringing.</p><h2 id=gordon-ramsay-loves-to-give-back-despite-a-tough-childhood>Gordon Ramsay Loves To Give Back Despite A Tough Childhood</h2><p>Gordon Ramsay is worth millions today. He's a proud family man and in addition, the chef works alongside several charitable causes.</p><p>However, things weren't always easy for the popular TV chef. As a child, <a href=#>he lived in a very abusive setting</a>. "Growing up, my father was less than a perfect role model. I watched how he battled alcoholism and how he became terribly violent with my mum, to the point where she feared for her life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Every time he got violent, any present that my brother, sisters, or I had given my mum would be smashed, simply because he knew it belonged to her. There were instances when the police were called to take him away; mum was taken to the hospital while we kids were taken to a children's home."</p><p>Despite the rough setting, Ramsay was able to create a better future for not only himself, but those around him.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Here's How Gordon Ramsay Feels About His Wife's Cooking</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmnqiqlKS7br7ApqqasV2ZvG7DyK2fZpmcoXq1tMRmnLGsopZ6p7vOnWSmmaOpsrOvx56daA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./selena-gomez-vows-never-to-be-a-meme-after-viral-vmas-reactions.html><span>←</span><span>Selena Gomez Vows Never to Be a 'Meme' After Viral VMAs Reactions</span></a>
