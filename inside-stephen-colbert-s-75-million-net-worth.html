Sadly, a great tragedy took place early in his life when his father and two brothers died in a plane crash. Colbert was just ten years old when this happened, and it's still an emotional topic for him (as it would be for anyone), <a href=#>even bringing Anderson Cooper to tears when discussing it in an interview.</a> Moving on from such a traumatic event isn't easy for an adult, let alone a child, but Colbert was able to triumph eventually.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Stephen Colbert Is Forever A Taylor Swift Fan Following The Artist's Interaction With His Daughter</a></span></p><p>Stephen Colbert began studying philosophy at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia. Later, he made a switch to Northwestern University in Illinois, where he was able to master his skills as a comedian in an improv group called the "No Fun Mud Piranhas." It was performing with them that led Colbert to his successful career today.</p><h2 id=stephen-colbert-39-s-budding-career><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Stephen Colbert's Budding Career</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/untitled-design-42.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After graduating from Northwestern, Colbert joined the Second City Improv in Chicago. While there, Stephen Colbert was able to work with other now-famous comedians like Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello. Working with other talented individuals only strengthened Colbert's on-the-spot humor. He is known for his quick comebacks today, proving that all of his time in improv was worth it and cleared the way for his success.</p><p>In 1997, Colbert joined the cast of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. This was and still is a playful news program; however, it is now hosted by Trevor Noah. It was this program that truly launched Colbert's career. During his time on the show, he showed the world his conservative, over-the-top political expertise. His clever commentary and humorous take on current events quickly boosted his ratings, making him a fan favorite.</p><h2 id=the-colbert-report-39-s-late-night-success><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Colbert Report's Late-Night Success</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Story-Behind-Jon-Batistes-Job-At-The-Late-Show-With-Stephen-Colbert.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2005, Stephen Colbert got the opportunity of a lifetime when Comedy Central offered him his own show, The Colbert Report. The show, very similar to his work with Jon Stewart, allowed Colbert to be the main event when it came to commentary. The Colbert Report quickly built up a loyal following, making it an instant success.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Stephen Colbert Couldn't Keep A Straight Face After Sandra Bullock Revealed The Only Autograph She Ever Asked For</a></span></p><p>The show was very unique in the fact that Colbert played a fictionalized version of himself, Dr. Stephen. This humorous approach allowed him to tackle complex political and social issues with amusement and absurdity, making it both informative and entertaining for viewers. Colbert had an amazing way of connecting with his audience. It was as if, even if you didn't agree with him, he made you take pause, gave you a different perspective, and challenged your own beliefs in a thought-provoking manner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stephen-colbert-39-s-financial-success><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Stephen Colbert's Financial Success</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/letterman-colbert.png><p>The Colbert Report ran for nine successful years, from 2005 to 2014, earning Colbert a substantial income and boosting his net worth significantly. According to Money.com,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he earned $6 million at the end of his tenure on Comedy Central.</a> During its run, the show won numerous awards, including multiple Primetime Emmy Awards, a GLAAD Award, and a Writers Guild Award. The show was successful because Colbert was able to get a host of famous people to come on and have humorous yet honest conversations with them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2014, Colbert announced that he would be leaving The Colbert Report to take over as the host of The Late Show, succeeding <strong><a href=#>David Letterman</a></strong>. This was a huge career move, and it came with <a href=#>a lucrative contract that actually surpassed Letterman's salary.</a> As he made his smooth transition from cable to a major network, Stephen Colbert didn't skip a beat. He continued to run things like an old pro, which further strengthened his role as one of the late-night television greats.</p><p>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert premiered in September 2015 and quickly rose to the top of late-night television. Colbert's unique monologues blended with humor and, of course, current political events resonate well with viewers all over the world, continuing to boost his ratings.</p><h2 id=stephen-colbert-39-s-earnings-from-the-late-show-and-contract-extensions><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Stephen Colbert's Earnings From The Late Show And Contract Extensions</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jon-stewart-and-stephen-colbert.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Continuous success and financial rewards have characterized Stephen Colbert's time as the host of The Late Show. His initial contract with CBS reportedly guaranteed him an annual salary of $4 million, but as the show's popularity grew, so did his earnings.</p><p>In 2019, <a href=#>he signed a contract extension that was estimated to be worth $16 million</a> per year. One of the reasons why Colbert earns a substantial income from The Late Show is because it consistently receives high ratings. The show's ability to draw in a large audience, especially during important moments in American politics, has made it a popular choice for advertisers.</p><h2 id=stephen-colbert-is-an-author><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Stephen Colbert Is An Author</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/your-paragraph-text-2023-09-05t173320-439.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from his television career, Stephen Colbert has been involved in other industries that have contributed to his overall wealth.
