Song Lyrics And Dance Compilation</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Busta Rhymes challenge on TikTok is really famous these days and his song ‘Touch It’ is really trending on the platform.</p><p>Busta Rhymes’ devoted following is well aware of how highly regarded he is for his unique flow, bars, and inventiveness. He was the rapper that got everyone hyped up in the clubs, but thanks to the Touch It TikTok challenge, his well-known song now gives the same feeling at home.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-busta-rhymes-challenge-on-tiktok></span>What Is Busta Rhymes Challenge On TikTok?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Busta Rhymes challenge is getting a lot of attention on TikTok.</p><p>The Touch It challenges have gained a lot of attraction on TikTok. People from all around the world participate in the festivities and display their artistic talents by fusing Busta Rhyme’s audio with different instruments.</p><p>The creators have added their own distinctive spin by twerking and wailing their waists at the conclusion of the dance. The Touch It challenges therefore seem to have a chance of becoming one of the platform’s most popular dances.</p><p>The already fantastic music has been given a little spice by the performers. The ingenuity of the TikTokers has not been limited by this trend. Therefore, if someone looking for a TikTok dancing challenge that isn’t too difficult to demonstrate their skills, the Touch It challenges is a wonderful place to start.</p><p>In TikTok dance challenges, people’s dancing abilities might be pushed to the ultimate test. Not all challenges are only open to producers with a sense of rhythm, despite the fact that there is a big dancing community on TikTok.</p><p>When Chris Brown and Rhymes released their single “Why Stop Now” in 2011, Rhymes encouraged his followers to attempt the fast-paced rap and submit footage of their attempts in his Spit Like Busta Rhymes competition. The Touch It challenge, however, is incredibly popular with the audience, and Tiktok is overflowing with it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=busta-rhymes-song-touch-it-lyrics-and-dance-compilation></span>Busta Rhyme’s Song Touch It Lyrics And Dance Compilation<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The song ‘Touch It’ by Busta Rhymes was released on December 13, 2005, as the first single from Rhymes’ Aftermath/Interscope debut album, The Big Bang.</p><p>The song reached number one and six in New Zealand and the UK, respectively. The song features a sample from the Daft Punk song “Technologic,” which also features a minimalistic beat by Swizz Beatz.</p><p>The song was included in Daft Punk’s live album, Alive 2007, and was made in the UK on May 15, 2006. However, “Touch It” managed to enter the top 40 on download sales alone one week before the song’s physical release, peaking at number 23 in accordance with UK chart criteria that allow singles to chart on download sales alone.</p><p>The song made its way to the highest ranking of number six after it was made available as a physical single. The song did very well on the charts by spending seven weeks in the top 30.</p><p>The Lyrics of the songs made it famous back then and the reason for the song to resurface on TikTok after so many years.</p><p>The song was sung so fast that it is nearly impossible to understand what the musician is trying to say, but its lyrics make it possible to understand it. Even though the song is somewhat difficult to understand, people have been loving it and doing dance compilations on TikTok.</p><p>The record was nonetheless pulled off after its successful run after the physical copies were destroyed because of new chart rules that said singles could only be in the chart for two weeks after their physical destruction.<br>However, its popularity is still alive, and the challenges on TikTok is the proof that the song is still one of the most successful and best songs of the decade.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-to-do-the-challenge></span>How To Do The Challenge?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Without question, Busta Rhymes’s challenges are currently the most sought-after and popular trend. Here is a quick rundown of the steps in bringing this trend alive.</p><p>The first step in creating this challenge is to dress simply and tastefully during; Shorty wilding and shorty open, she beasting it out. For the record, just a second, I’m freaking it out.</p><p>And after the beat, Touch it, bring it, babe, watch it. Turn it, leave it, stop, format it. Touch it, bring it, babe, watch it. Turn it, leave it, stop, format it, and the artists transform ordinary clothing into elegant attire. Twerking to the rhythm has been used by some to modify the trend.</p><p>The lyrics are utilized throughout this brief segment of the video, which lasts about 30 seconds. Anyone who uses TikTok or likes decent music should at least give this trend a shot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutdJmma6rpJZ6s7TYppysZZOdrq24xKeenmWfo3q1tcqtpqRlo6S7qHnLsqmim6Nirq%2BwjJ2Yp5uVYrCwuc%2Bio5qsmaS7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyga-receives-anesthesia-before-8-hour-tattoo-session.html><span>←</span><span>Tyga Receives Anesthesia Before 8-Hour Tattoo Session</span></a>
