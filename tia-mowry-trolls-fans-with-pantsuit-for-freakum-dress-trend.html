Mowry, however, didn’t let the comments get to her. Instead, she doubled down, posting a new video on Tuesday, November 7, that showed her in another pair of pants.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Heard y’all were talking about me on Twitter, y’all ain’t ever heard of a ‘freakum’ pantsuit?” Mowry captioned an Instagram video that showed her in a white lace getup while Beyoncé’s tune played in the background. The ensemble included an embroidered blazer with high-waisted bottoms that featured see-through fabric.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Mowry’s followers praised the look, with one fan taking to the comments section to write, “She said lemme try again. I love this!!!”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>A second social media user wrote, “A freakum pantsuit is wild, but this is fire,” as a third added, “This suit is EVERYTHING!!!!”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Mowry exclusively opened up to Us Weekly about the viral moment on Thursday, November 9, while promoting her new JCPenney partnership that introduces the #PennyPrepperChallenge, a new social media challenge to encourage holiday hosts to share how they buy all of their party supplies for under $300.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Tia-Mowry-Trolls-Fans-With-Another-Pants-After-They-Said-She-Did-Beyonces-Freakum-Dress-Trend-Wrong-10.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I was like, ‘What is going on?’” Mowry said of fans reviving the two-year-old TikTok clip. “I shot that video two and a half years ago, and I was like, ‘What better way to clap back than to make fun of yourself?’ I’m at that place where I’m not taking things too seriously.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Mowry continued, “I’m all about <a href=#>moving on with love and compassion</a>, so I was like, ‘Let me just redo this video.’”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The <a href=#>Sister, Sister </a>alum asserted, however, that she’s “not changing for nobody” and won’t be wearing a “freakum dress” just because people want her to.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“That’s not going to happen,” Mowry told Us. “[I was like], ‘Let me just have fun,’ and I did.
