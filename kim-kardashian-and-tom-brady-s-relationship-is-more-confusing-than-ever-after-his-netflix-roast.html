The live roast lasted three hours, was unedited, and was just the start of Netflix's journey into live programming.</p><p>The former NFL quarterback took hilarious punches from some of his closest friends, athletes, and celebrities, including Kardashian. Most of the jokes revolved around his <a href=# rel=nofollow>divorce from supermodel Gisele Bündchen</a> and his love life, including<strong> rumors about him dating Kardashian.</strong> Not one to shy away from fame or romance-fueled rumors, Kardashian looked happy on stage as she roasted her former rumored love interest. Knowing Kardashian's love life is constantly in the press, things could be a little tricky between her and Brady after her appearance wasn't well-received by audiences. Below, we'll take a<strong> </strong>closer look at what <strong>Kim Kardashian revealed about her relationship with Tom Brady </strong>on The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, how their relationship began, and where they stand today.<strong></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian-won-39-t-reveal-if-she-dated-tom-brady-at-his-netflix-roast>Kim Kardashian Won't Reveal If She Dated Tom Brady At His Netflix Roast</h2><p>Although <strong>Kim Kardashian and Tom Brady have known each other for a few years</strong>, their hypothetical relationship became complicated at the live Netflix roast.</p><p>"I wasn’t going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might," Kardashian quipped. She said, "Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were, and I'd never say if we did or not. I'd just release the tape."</p><p>The tape, of course, is in reference to her infamous sex tape with R&B singer Ray J.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/screenshot-2024-05-06-at-10-37-04-pm.png><p>Kardashian continued making digs at Brady's expense during the roast, while also bringing up some of the more juicy topics that made her famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, it looks like <strong>fans will never know if Kardashian and Brady dated </strong>unless one of them came clean about their time together, but her roast suggested that it would never work out because of Brady's resemblance to her stepdad, Caitlyn Jenner. "I do know it would never work out. An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair, you remind me too much of my stepdad now," she joked.</p><h2 id=where-do-kim-kardashian-and-tom-brady-stand-today>Where Do Kim Kardashian And Tom Brady Stand Today?</h2><p>After three hours of getting roasted by his close friends, Tom Brady took the comments in jest. However, seeing as Kim Kardashian got booed at a roast that wasn't for her, Brady came to her defense lightheartedly, but not without some shade.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tom-brady-in-sunglasses-during-an-interview.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kanye-west-and-kim-kardashian-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Psychology Experts Hold Kim Kardashian Accountable For Kanye West's Parenting Antics</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Experts say Kanye West's bipolar disorder isn't to blame; there's "much deeper going on" in his erratic behavior.</span><p><strong>Brady later took the mic and made a dig at Kardashian</strong> to make it an equal playing field.</p><p>"I know Kim [Kardashian] was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad," the famous quarterback joked.</p><p>Seeing as Kardashian's ex-husband Kanye West has been in hot water as of late for his <a href=#>toxic workplace lawsuits</a>, political points of view, and relationship with <a href=#>his wife Bianca Censori</a>, the dig could complicate things for Kardashian and Brady if they ever wound up dating in the future. Past insults towards one another in the press don't typically bode well for future couples.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-was-booed-at-tom-brady-39-s-roast>Kim Kardashian Was Booed At Tom Brady's Roast</h2><p>Wearing a tight black dress, diamonds, and holding a glass of champagne, Kim Kardashian looked flawless as she was escorted to the podium by actor and comedian Jeff Ross. However, <strong>the cheers slowly turned into booing </strong>once she thanked the crowd. Her smile turned crooked as host Kevin Hart jumped in to save Kardashian and lighten things up before she carried on with her roast, trying to take the criticism with grace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/blonde-kim-kardashian.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/your-paragraph-text-2024-05-01t112627-860.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Felt Like Kim Kardashian Purposely Changed Subject On Jimmy Kimmel When Asked About Her Mom's Church</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Fans felt as though Kim Kardashian was quick to change subject after Jimmy Kimmel asked about a certain church internet rumor.</span><p>Since the roast was about Tom Brady, Kardashian finished her quips before taking her seat. At the same time, Brady smiled and laughed at Kardashian's digs, which centered around their rumored dating life, Caitlyn Jenner, and her former adoration for NFL players. Seeing as only the best of the best were invited to Brady's roast,<strong> </strong>fans quickly wondered if the two did date and when the rumors started.</p><h2 id=when-did-the-dating-rumors-start-between-kim-kardashian-and-tom-brady>When Did The Dating Rumors Start Between Kim Kardashian And Tom Brady?</h2><p>Back in October 2022, Cosmopolitan shared that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen divorced</a>. As two highly publicized public figures, fans of the former couple wanted to know who they were going to date next. In May 2023, it was shared by People that <strong>Kim Kardashian was the next gorgeous celebrity that Tom Brady</strong> was potentially courting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-greatest-roast-of-all-time-tom-brady-interview.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Tom Brady Visibly Uncomfortable As He Was Roasted About Gisele Bundchen's Alleged Cheating</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Kevin Hart brought up the rumors about Gisele Bundchen's cheating, and Tom Brady wasn't amused.</span><p>Although no pictures were taken of the pair at the party, it was reported by the Daily Mail that <strong>Kardashian was looking for vacation properties near Brady's home</strong> in the islands of the Bahamas. Shortly after the rumors flooded the internet, reps for the pair quickly denied their dating. A close source to the Kardashians told People,<strong> </strong>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They have friends and business partners in common, but are not dating</a>.<strong> </strong>Kim is very focused on her kids, her businesses, law school, and preparing for American Horror Story which starts production next month."</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Marriage Information </strong>Via: PopSugar</p></td><td><p><strong>Number Of Years Married</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Children</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tom Brady and Gisele Búndchen</p></td><td><p>13 years married</p></td><td><p>Three</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kim Kardashian and Kanye West</p></td><td><p>Six years married</p></td><td><p>Four</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tom-brady-is-slammed-with-plastic-surgery-rumors-after_gr-1.jpg><p>However, according to the NY Post, the two were later seen chatting closely <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">at a friend's party on the Fourth of July</a>. A source told People that <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian had a "crush" on Tom Brady</a> </strong>after conversing and had "liquid courage" to talk to him. Nevertheless, the two vehemently shared that they were and are just friends.</p><p>Bringing up old baggage or making digs at past partners could make things murky for the two if they spark a future romantic relationship. However, both would have to be single for that to happen. While Kim Kardashian and NFL <a href=#>boyfriend Odell Beckham Jr.</a> reportedly broke up, Tom Brady has been quietly seeing supermodel Irina Shayk since 2023. As is the case for any celebrity friendship with oodles of chemistry, anything can happen between these two stars in the future!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmLBsLmMm6manKliv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxec2eq5%2Bkma16s7vArKto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-and-kanye-west-the-perfect-match.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian and Kanye West: The Perfect Match</span></a>
