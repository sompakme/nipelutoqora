Ray Lewis, a Hall of Famer in professional football, will make his ballroom debut this year and already has several well-known dance steps. If you’re a football fan, you might be familiar with the former Baltimore Ravens linebacker’s “Squirrel” dance.</p><p>While we might anticipate seeing game-day movements in a performance (or two), not everyone could be voting for the former NFL standout. The professional athlete faced two murder allegations about 20 years ago. Does this mean Ray gets away with murder?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ray Lewis and the murder case</h2><p>Lewis played for the Baltimore Ravens for his 17-year career after being chosen by them in the 1996 NFL Draught.</p><p>He left the company in 2013. Lewis was selected to play in 13 Pro Bowls during his career. And the Ravens won two Super Bowls while he was a team member.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-11-1024x547.png><p>Lewis addressed the significance of his career to the community in which his club played during his 2018 induction speech into the Football Hall of Fame.&nbsp;</p><p>Lewis stated on Twitter, “Crime decreased in Baltimore when I played.” “At this point, I don’t think anyone can afford to be upset.</p><p>Everyone seems to want to rejoice and celebrate, he continued. Lewis was accused of a crime about two decades before giving his statement, which did not cause a celebration.</p><p>Lewis was charged with the murder of two men in January 2000. The star Ravens player had gone to an Atlanta Super Bowl party.&nbsp;</p><p>According to NPR, Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar were fatally stabbed after a battle that broke out at around 4 a.m. on January 31 due to an incident with Lewis’ companions.</p><p>Later that night, a witness is said to have heard Lewis saying to companions, “I’m not trying to end my career like this,” according to USA Today, before fleeing the area in his limousine, where the victim’s blood was discovered. Lewis eventually admitted guilt as a result of this.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did Ray Lewis get away with murder?</h2><p>In 2000, Ray Lewis was first accused of murder, but he immediately had those charges dropped.</p><p>The Baltimore Ravens star reportedly pleaded guilty to obstructing justice and agreed to testify against his two friends, Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting, who were also charged with murder.</p><p>The two other defendants were on trial for Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar’s murders, which resulted from the Super Bowl party fight. Ultimately, the murder charges against both Sweeting and Oakley were dropped.</p><p>&nbsp;The stabbings were not admitted to by anyone else. And the investigation remained open. During an interview with USA Today in 2013, a relative of the victim [Baker] said, “My nephew had been viciously assaulted and murdered, and nobody is paying for it.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12.png><p>Lewis was not indicted for murder. But the NFL fined him $250,000 for giving police false information. Paul Tagliabue, commissioner of the NFL at the time, reportedly told ABC <a href=#>News</a> as much.&nbsp;</p><p>He stated: “In doing so, he needlessly harmed his livelihood and reputation and did significant damage to other NFL players and the league.”</p><p>Because there were still unanswered questions regarding Lewis’ involvement in the attacks, his nightmare was far from ending. Smith’s family filed their lawsuit in 2004 after Baker’s family sued Lewis for wrongful death in 2003.&nbsp;</p><p>According to CBS Sports, the NFL star gave undisclosed amounts to both families. What happened to the clothing Lewis wore that night was the most pressing concern.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The suit of Ray Lewis remains a mystery.</h2><p>The cream-colored suit Ray Lewis wore the night of the infamous Super Bowl party was a crucial piece of evidence that was lost and never found during the murder trial.&nbsp;</p><p>Handsome Lollar, the brother of stabbed victim Richard Lollar, questioned USA Today in 2019: “Where’s that white suit that was all bloody?”The family of the second victim, Jacinth Baker, expressed similar concerns.</p><p>If something else that implicated them in the murder had gone missing that night, why would that information have also disappeared? Baker’s uncle, Greg Wilson, spoke to USA Today.</p><p>The missing suit was a significant component of the legal litigation brought against Lewis years earlier.</p><p>Lewis claims that he was unfairly singled out as a murder suspect. The former Baltimore Raven discussed the stigma attached to him and the trial in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>Lewis told NPR 2015, “But nobody ever wants to say that from day one, there was not one inch of evidence on me.” A few years later, when the surviving relatives of Baker and Lollar were questioned over the former player’s involvement in the murders, Lewis was slated to be inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2018.</p><p>Robert Klemko of Sports Illustrated questioned Lewis about the incident and got no answer from the Hall of Famer.&nbsp;</p><p>Respectfully, this is my place. Klemko was instructed by Lewis, “You need to locate a place to live right now.” Despite the looming drama, I’m done talking about the murder charges.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2BwLJkpZ2nnsBuudSrm56qXZiutLGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katey-sagal-married-with-children-was-misogynistic.html><span>←</span><span>Katey Sagal: 'Married With Children' Was 'Misogynistic'</span></a>
