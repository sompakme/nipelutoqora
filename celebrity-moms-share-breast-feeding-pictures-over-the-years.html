The Shades of Rose designer wound up in the hospital the previous month with <a href=#>mastitis</a>, breast tissue inflammation that can result in an infection.</p><p>“Hate this for her,” the former Bachelor said on his Instagram Story in July 2021. “She’s been through a lot this week. … Really tough last few days.”</p><p>Bellisario also suffered from mastitis while breast-feeding her eldest daughter, Aurora, born in October 2018.</p><p>“It has been a joy, an honor and a no brainer to feed my daughter this way,” the actress wrote via Instagram of <a href=#>her “complicated” relationship with nursing</a> in August 2019. “My body has made it easy for us and I have loved every moment I get to spend this kind of time with her. Not every mother gets that. I don’t know if I will have it for much longer, but I will always take care of her and do what is best for us. (F–k pumping. Love you forever babay girl).”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Los Angeles native, who is also the mother of daughter Elliot, noted that her “milk came in immediately” the first time around and Aurora “has always eaten well.” Bellisario added, “Breast-feeding her was never painful or frustrating (SO RARE).”</p><p>Keep scrolling to check out other stars, including <a href=#><strong>Jamie Lynn Spears</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Mandy Moore</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Stassi Schroeder</strong></a>, who have shown off their nursing photos — as well as their adorable babies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJtkpqedqHq0tMCrnGaaopqutMDFnpydoZ6cerG1wq2sq52jYn9xfZNub2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aaron-hernandez-s-fiancee-shayanna-slams-tom-brady-s-jokes.html><span>←</span><span>Aaron Hernandezs Fiancee Shayanna Slams Tom Bradys Jokes</span></a>
