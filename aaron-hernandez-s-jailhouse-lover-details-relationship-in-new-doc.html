He used to tell me he wanted to marry me. Anything I ever wanted in life, he would make sure it came true.”</p><p>Before <a href=#>dying by suicide</a> in April 2017, Hernandez turned to Kennedy for support while in prison for the murder of his friend Odin Lloyd. The former New England Patriots player was set to serve a life sentence, but took his own life in his prison cell before his sentence was complete.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Aaron-Hernandez-Jailhouse-Lover-Kyle-Kennedy-Interview-4.jpg><p>“We would lock in to either cook food or smoke, get high, listen to music, just chill when we didn’t want to be around other people, I had never done anything like this before,” Kennedy said of his former lover. “We used to write letters back and forth to each other all day.”</p><p>The pair’s relationship <a href=#>quickly became sexual</a>, with Kennedy claiming that they would be physical with one another “once or twice a week.” During their time together in jail, he noticed Hernandez growing more and more “paranoid” about his future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Aaron-Hernandez-Jailhouse-Lover-Kyle-Kennedy-Interview-3.jpg><p>“He was more worried about if he was going to go home or not,” Kennedy explained. “He did whatever he had to do or if he ever felt disrespected or someone ever disrespected his people or someone he cared for, he would act on it.”</p><p>Hernandez was arrested in June 2013, less than one year after welcoming daughter Avielle with his fiancée, <a href=#><strong>Shayanna Jenkins</strong></a>. According to TMZ, the late athlete <a href=#>left a note for Jenkins</a> before his death.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Aaron-Hernandez-Jailhouse-Lover-Kyle-Kennedy-Interview.jpg><p>“You have always been my soulmate and I want you to love life and know I’m always with you.
