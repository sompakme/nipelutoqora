As a recently-minted young adult, Rick's first major storyline was slightly disturbing, but not entirely surprising considering his upbringing. His mother, Brooke Logan, had hired a live-in babysitter named Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz) to watch over his younger sister Bridget, and he promptly started a scandalous affair with her (via <a href=#>Soap Central</a>). Rick's relationship with the nanny eventually turned serious and the two married. Amber later got pregnant, though tragically their son was stillborn.</p><p dir=ltr>Young left the soap after a few years, but continued to appear on daytime. From 2000 to 2003 he played Lucky Spencer on "General Hospital," and starred as JR Chandler on "All My Children" from 2003 to 2011, before returning to "B&B" to reprise his first role. He has been nominated for Daytime Emmys for all of his soap roles, winning once for his work as Lucky. Though two others portrayed Rick during Young's hiatus, he is the longest-running and most recognizable actor to play the character.</p><p>In the seven years after his return, Rick bounced back and forth between Caroline Spencer II and Maya Avant, both of whom he was married to for a time, per <a href=#>Soaps in Depth</a>. <a href=#>Rick and Maya</a> share a child named Lizzie Forrester who was born via surrogacy in 2016. In 2018, the little family moved overseas, though Maya briefly returned home to tell their loved ones they were getting a divorce. Rick hasn't been seen on-screen in a few years, but there's always a chance that he'll pop back up unexpectedly — played by Young or someone else.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57mHFwbm5hZK6tuIytn55lkZjBsL7SZq6hp12luaLFxJ1kraCVYq%2BwuMNmmKecXam1pnnBnpiurJmbwq2%2FjKugnKNdm7yzvsSsq56qXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-look-at-the-queen-s-gambit-star-anya-taylor-joy-s-rise-to-the-top.html><span>←</span><span>A Look At 'The Queen's Gambit Star Anya Taylor-Joy's Rise To The Top</span></a>
