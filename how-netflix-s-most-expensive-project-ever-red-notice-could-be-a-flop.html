Well, those times are long gone as the streaming service has spearheaded a new mode of entertainment consumption, making the act of&nbsp;bingeing your go-to happy show or finding the best new blockbuster as easy as pressing a button on your remote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With innovation comes competition, as countless entertainment services like Paramount+, Hulu, and <a href=#>Disney+</a> have emerged, hopping onto the streaming bandwagon. Though, in the&nbsp;race of networks producing larger than life movies and episodic series on beyond lofty, multi-million dollar budgets, <a href=#>Netflix remains as a front runner</a>.</p><p>The platform was responsible for this year's biggest win in binge-worthy content, as <a href=#>Squid Game</a> was released&nbsp;and became a worldwide craze. While the nine episode series only cost Netflix around $21 million to make, it's international buzz is&nbsp;estimated to make the service around $900 million!&nbsp;With the company making their most expensive deal to date by acquiring&nbsp;<a href=#>Roald Dahl Story Company for $700 million</a>, it's clear that Netflix is more than willing to put its money where its mouth is to dominate the streaming game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Netflix is looking for yet another big win with the Gal Gadot, Ryan Reynolds, and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson starring movie, Red Notice. The action comedy film, which has a&nbsp; November 12th streaming date coupled with its November 5th theatrical debut, is said to be Netflix's most ambitious project. The production company dropped $200 million to make the film happen! While it may may have cost a pretty penny to produce, critics and audiences aren't quite so sure if Red Notice was worth nine figure price tag.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Almost A Billion: Netflix’s ‘Squid Game’ Shall Reportedly Generate Around $900 Million In Impact Value</a></span></p><h2 id=a-fierce-bidding-war>A Fierce Bidding War</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Red Notice was in the hands of Netflix, the film was on the table for a number of studios to acquire. A bidding war between virtually all of the top movie-making companies was underway to take up this, then only Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson headlining, action/comedy flick. While the top dogs of the industry - including Warner Bros/New Line, Paramount Pictures, and Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. - were all looking to cash in on this truly expensive project, it was Universal Pictures and Legendary Pictures<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> who teamed up to win the rights</a> to Red Notice. Taking on the project alone came with a hefty $10 million fee. The production studios initially had ambitions of spending a proposed budget of $125-$150 million.</p><p>Though, just months later, the studio was given the option to shop the film around for any other takers of the massive project. It was <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">then was sold to Netflix</a>, adding Reynolds and Gadot to the cast in the process. Production was briefly halted during the pandemic, only to continue afterward with a 2021 premiere date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stars-getting-paid-big-bucks>Stars Getting Paid Big Bucks</h2><p>It would be no less than a crime if the leading actors and actresses didn't get a pretty hefty paycheck for starring in Netflix's biggest project to date. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Reynolds was slated to make $20 million from his part in Red Notice.</p><p>Gadot was reported to make the same amount from her base salary and additionally back end compensation generated from the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">film's performance at the box office.</a> Though, coupled with the film receiving less than raving reviews, Red Notice's streaming release will likely put the starlet in the same predicament as <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlet Johannsson in Disney's Black Widow</a>. When Black Widow's box office performance was hindered by the film's simultaneous release onto Disney+, the actress' salary was substantially less than expected, and she took <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">legal action against the entertainment giant</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because he is credited as a producer, Johnson is said to make millions more than his castmates when Netflix adds his bonuses.</p><h2 id=a-box-office-flop>A Box Office Flop?</h2><p>Red Notice was only shown in 750 theaters across the country, a slim number compared to its competition. While Netflix doesn't release the numbers on its film's theatrical performance, sources from <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> have projected that it likely made $1.5 million within the first three days that it debuted. Compared to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel and Disney's Eternals</a> - a new movie that also reportedly had a $200 million budget - Red Notice's numbers aren't stacking up. Eternals made a whopping $71 million on its first weekend, making it the fourth-biggest opening within the pandemic.</p><p>While Eternals may have succeeded despite less than favorable critics, it's looking like Red Notice may not be able to meet the same fate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Reportedly the most expensive Netflix original production to date, Red Notice would have benefited if some of its $200m budget had been spent on untangling the screenplay," says Wendy Idel of <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Observer</a> .</p><p>If the consensus of Netflix's streaming audience is anywhere near as unpleased as those who saw the movie in person - or alternatively, decided against seeing it through word of mouth - the network may be in a pickle to make up the hundreds of millions of dollars they funneled into this project.</p><p><span class=next-single>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>'No Time to Die' Becomes The 2nd Hollywood Movie With Almost $500 Million In Box Office Sales</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Observer</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1sMOMp5ytnpyexbR5zKiqrWWVrb2mutKirZ5loKe8q7HCrWSerpWnerOxw2alqKyZmLJur86uo51lkpp6onnFpaapZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./holly-donaldson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Holly Donaldson Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
