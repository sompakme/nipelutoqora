Shows like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Office</a>, and even reality shows like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jersey Shore</a>&nbsp;all show what happens when a network does things just right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>9-1-1: Lone Star might only have one season under its belt, but the show is a success and has been renewed for another year. Liv Tyler is one of the leads on the show, but it was announced that she will be exiting. The network laid the pieces down for a hit show, but even they must not have seen this coming.</p><p>Let’s see why Liv Tyler left&nbsp;9-1-1: Lone Star.</p><h2 id=the-show-was-a-success>The Show Was A Success</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/005D9D48-BDD0-495D-84A5-322F3DC5240E.jpeg><p>Networks want nothing more than to bring a new show to life and have it become a success, and fortunately for Fox, 9-1-1: Lone Star&nbsp;was able to catch on with an audience in no time at all. Of course, leaning on some talented and proven performers was a smart move.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>9-1-1: Lone Star&nbsp;was led by performers Rob Lowe and Liv Tyler, both of whom had already found plenty of success in the entertainment industry. Rob Lowe had initially broken out in films like The Outsiders and would go on to other successful movies like Wayne’s World over time, but on the small screen, he was able to thrive and have a huge career resurgence on the series Parks and Recreation,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;IMDb.</p><p>While Liv Tyler had done work on the small screen at different points during her career, she has been best known for her work on the big screen. Tyler‘s biggest role to date has been as the character Arwen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which many consider to be the greatest of all time. She was also featured in Armageddon and The Incredible Hulk, making her an early part of the MCU.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lowe and Tyler, along with the rest of the talented cast, were able to attract viewers to 9-1-1: Lone Star&nbsp;shortly after it&nbsp;debuted. Despite the success, an unpredictable event would ultimately change things for Liv Tyler and her participation in the hit show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Stars From The ’80s Who Are Still Just As Relevant Today</a></span></p><h2 id=she-left-due-to-concerns-about-the-pandemic>She Left Due To Concerns About The Pandemic</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/623AD1E4-7035-42AB-B6DE-5F722C665C61.jpeg><p>Things can change in an instant in the entertainment industry, but it is not too common to see a lead performer exit a series after just one season. However, this did not stop Liv Tyler from making the tough decision to leave 9-1-1: Lone Star&nbsp;behind after things around the world changed in an instant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tim Minear, the co-creator of the show would <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">issue a statement</a>, saying, “What a thrill it was having a movie star of Liv Tyler’s stature to help us launch the first season of 911: Lone Star.&nbsp;We loved working with Liv and will be forever indebted to her for her haunting, powerful portrayal of Michelle Blake.”</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, growing concerns about travel and filming during the pandemic is ultimately what caused a change of plans for Tyler. The actress lives out in London and filming is done primarily in Los Angeles. Given everything that is going on, it is understandable that the performer would question her future on the show.</p><p>Despite losing out on such a talented performer who was responsible for the show becoming a success, the series still has more stories to tell.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Movie Stars Who Became Completely Unrecognizable For Their Roles</a></span></p><h2 id=the-show-will-go-on>The Show Will Go On</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/361FA2F1-0BAD-4BCB-AD4E-61F81C8C6B75.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter, the show will be coming back for a second season. This is good news for fans that have come to love the show, and there are so many ways that the writers can take things, even after Tyler’s departure.</p><p>In Minear’s statement, he would say, “While we were able to tell a complete chapter in Michelle’s story, as with Connie Britton on our mothership, we also feel like there are more stories to be told. The door here will always be open for a return.”</p><p>This is amazing for fans and Tyler alike, as the show will leave the door open for her to come back when things around the world improve. Of course, there is no guarantee that the show will be around for future seasons after the second one airs, but if it does, then Liv Tyler coming back would be a welcome addition.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Times Celebrities Photobombed Their Fans</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>9-1-1: Lone Star has gotten off to a strong start, and despite losing a real talent like Liv Tyler, the series will have the chance to continue to thrive on the small screen.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Celebs Who Love Howard Stern (& 5 Who Stay Away From Him)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecuirWasqaGys3nLnpivnV1uenJ5kGajqKaVYsC1rdFo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-solange-knowles-do-for-a-living.html><span>←</span><span>What Does Solange Knowles Do For A Living?</span></a>
