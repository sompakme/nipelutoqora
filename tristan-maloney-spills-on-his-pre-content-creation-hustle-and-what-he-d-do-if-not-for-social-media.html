I'm used to just me, my phone, and my creative process."</p><p>However, he's adamant that those jitters are just par for the course.</p><p>"Better to say, 'I tried,' than always think, 'What if?'"</p><h2 id=tristan-reveals-where-he-finds-inspiration>Tristan Reveals Where He Finds Inspiration</h2><p>We're certainly hoping to see Tristan on bigger screens soon, but in the meantime, the content he creates will certainly suffice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On that, we asked if he could conclude our chat by naming where he finds his inspiration.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, given how he's previously told TheThings about his family's supportiveness, the first place he points is his loved ones.</p><p>"Hanging out with my family and friends gives me so many ideas for skits. No matter what we're doing, there's always something funny."</p><p>On top of them, he adds that a number of comedians and actors serve as his inspiration, on a regular basis.</p><p>"I could give a horrendously long list, but just to give an idea, Jim Carrey, Jack Black, Adam Sandler, Robin Williams, Chevy Chase, Vince Vaughn, Ryan Reynolds ... yeah, too many!"</p><p>Well, wherever he's getting his inspo, it's working!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicsZucqsCqwsRmq6uho6mur3nMmqOoppWuerS8yKWjrGWfo3qptdJmp6udXZi8r8DEp6tmm6KarrW1zqdkoa2jqbmmecCnm2avmJbBbrTEnWSdp12es266zq1kn6eiYsCwr8iao2allZm2ons%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./top-10-big-brother-winners-ranked-by-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Top 10 'Big Brother' Winners Ranked By Net Worth</span></a>
