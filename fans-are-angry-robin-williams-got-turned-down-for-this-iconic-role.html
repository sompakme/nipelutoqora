Soon enough, he made the jump to television, appearing on 'Mork & Mindy'. He would ultimately shine in film, adapting to roles of all genres, whether it be a pure comedy or a serious drama.<span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robin Williams Nearly Played This Iconic 'Harry Potter' Character</a></span>Williams had one project in particular that he was very attached to. In 1989, he was linked to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Burton's Batman</a>, taking on the role of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Joker.</a>He was so close to becoming a part of the memorable film, though he was eventually pushed aside to make way for Jack Nicholson.Williams would be attached to the project in future renditions and he would even accept another role in the film as another villain. Ultimately, it wasn't meant to be, and fans aren't happy about it.Let's take a look at exactly what went down behind the scenes and how Williams got snubbed. We'll also take a look at why fans are angry with the decision not to cast the late legend in the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicholson-gets-the-role>Nicholson Gets The Role</h2><p>It is arguably the greatest Batman film of all time, created by Tim Burton back in 1989. The film was a monster hit at the box office, bringing in $411 million. Things could've looked much different, as Williams was not only considered for the role but he was told that the part was his.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Nicholson Made $50 Million As The Joker. Here’s How He Did It</a></span></p><p>It is said that Warner Brothers used this approach as a tactic to further entice Jack Nicholson to take on the role. The goal worked, as Williams was replaced by another iconic actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robin admitted alongside Yahoo Entertainment that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he would've loved to have taken on the role</a>, "Oh God, I’d love to do that one,” he said. “I think you can really explore how bright and how nasty-funny he is, just like I guess what Kevin [Spacey] did with Lex Luthor [in Superman Returns], made him really funny, but yet still damaged.”</p><p>In fact, Williams would also state that he was open to playing any type of role in the Batman films, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including The Riddler</a>, "I would work with Chris again in a second, playing anyone in anything,” he told Empire. “I’d play the Riddler in the next Batman, although it’d be hard to top Heath as the villain, and I’m a little hairy for tights.”</p><p>Nicholson would feel a similar sentiment to Williams years later, when the role of The Joker went to Heath Ledger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly, Jack wasn't pleased, "Let me be the way I'm not in interviews. I'm furious. I'm furious. [He laughs.] They never asked me about a sequel with the Joker. I know how to do that! Nobody ever asked me."</p><p>"The Joker comes from my childhood. That's how I got involved with it in the first place. It's a part I always thought I should play."</p><p>We can say without hesitation, Ledger was tremendous in his place, the late actor truly revolutionized the role.</p><p>However, despite the success, fans are still wondering what things would've been like with Williams at the helm.</p><h2 id=fans-wanted-williams-in-the-role-at-least-once>Fans Wanted Williams In The Role At Least Once</h2><p>Reddit and Twitter both have fans discussing what could've been. On Reddit specifically, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans can't believe there wasn't any type of role for Williams</a>, even something rather than The Joker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He had so many chances and no one bet on him. Joker, Penguin, Riddler Hugo Strange, Riddler again... Dude really wanted to be a part of the Bat-Fam..."</p><p>"One of my all-time fav actors. I think he would have been great as Joker. Some of his best work was when he surprised you. One Hour Photo is a perfect example."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Science Says Watching The Recent 'Joker' Movie Can Turn You Into A Hater</a></span></p><p>Fans also believe he could've brought out a different version to the character.</p><p>"I couldn't see him playing a violent Joker. I could see a trickster Joker, but not violent."</p><p>Twitter felt the same way, with most fans believing he could've thrived if given the chance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They'll always be so many, "what ifs?" At the very least, those in his place thrived in the role and we really can't imagine anyone else in their spots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Williams will always be remembered as an interesting option for that character. Without a doubt, he would've brought his own unique spin and thrived in the spot.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Mrs. Doubtfire’ Actress Lisa Jakub Recalls How Robin Williams Was Always Open About Mental Health</a></span></p><p>Sources: Twitter, Yahoo Entertainment, Reddit & MTV</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYq6zsYyapaCqqWK%2FsK7Ip2SwoZyhtqK50maeqKxdqcKzusSdZJ2np6N6p7vRZquhoaNitqS7zaKaZqqfobJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daniel-lapaine-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Daniel Lapaine Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
