Miller now recalls the “madness and chaos” of their relationship, which also included the drama of Law’s affair with him and his ex-wife <strong>Sadie Frost</strong>‘s nanny playing out in the public eye.</p><p>“It makes you go completely mad, which is ideal for them,” she said <a href=# rel=noopener>in an interview</a> on SiriusXM’s This Life of Mine with James Corden. “The more you spiral, the better it is in terms of selling papers — that English thing of just wanting to tear people down. It felt so celebratory.”</p><p>Miller, 42, contrasted the high of an ascendant acting career coming at the same time she fell in love with Law, 51, with the constant scrutiny from the media.</p><p>“I just started working and I was in a big film and in love with this idol, and very, very happy, but the flip side of it was so dark, so quickly,” she said.</p><p>Miller added that as a young woman, she had “very little agency” in how her story was portrayed in the press. As a result, she began drinking “too much” and going out too often, reflecting behavior she saw from other celebrities throughout the aughts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sienna-Miller-Recalls-Madness-and-Chaos-of-Jude-Law-Relationship-3.jpg><p>“But that also breeds more panic and it was just an ouroboros of kind of mess,” she said. “[There was] a lot of chaos personally with our relationship, and I think everything fed into itself, and it just became this very unmanageable energy.”</p><p>The chaos came to a boiling point once news broke of Law’s affair. In a 2020 interview with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Daily Beast</a>, Miller said she <a href=#>has no recollection</a> of the six weeks that followed.</p><p>“People who came to see me and said we had dinner, and I don’t remember,” she admitted. “I was in so much shock over it all. And I’d really just begun. I was 23. But if you get through that, you feel like you could get through anything.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sienna-Miller-Recalls-Madness-and-Chaos-of-Jude-Law-Relationship-1.jpg><p>Law did issue a public apology directed at Miller, but that did little to quell Miller’s inner turmoil.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I see other people who went through it and didn’t kind of come out the other side as well, so I’m quite proud,” she told Corden.</p><p>Law has seven children, including three that he shares with Frost, to whom he was married before his relationship with Miller. He is currently married to <strong>Phillipa Coan</strong>.</p><p>Miller later became engaged to actor <strong>Tom Sturridge</strong>, and the two share a daughter, Marlowe, 11. She is currently dating actor <strong>Oli Green</strong> and <a href=#>the two welcomed a daughter</a> in late 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoZWju6J5zKKjpZ2iYr%2Bmr8Clo6xlnZaxr7HSrGSappRisKmtzqxkqJ5dn8KlsYylmLBlopq5osDIqKWsoJmlfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hope-hicks-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html><span>←</span><span>Hope Hicks Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
