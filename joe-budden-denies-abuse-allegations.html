Mr. Budden has fully cooperated with the investigation. Mr. Budden asks for patience as the evidence and facts unfold to demonstrate the truth of his involvement and the real events that transpired on the night in question. – Nima Ameri, Esq.” As for his personal thoughts on the matter?</p><p>Messy break ups are so..
