But the Olympian, 69, had nothing but praise for <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> on Tuesday, December 11.</p><p>Caitlyn, who appeared on 13 seasons of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, reflected on Kim’s success while speaking at a panel during a WE tv event in Beverly Hills.</p><p>“You take Kimberly… She has been doing this show for, like, 12, 13, years now and has stayed relevant,” the former E! personality gushed. “You see actors come in and do their job and they’re relevant for one show or one movie and then you don’t see them for three years. Kimberly’s been out there; she’s extremely smart.”</p><p>Caitlyn and the 63-year-old momager tied the knot in 1991, one month after Kris’ divorce from Robert Kardashian was finalized. The I Am Cait alum helped Kris raise kids <a href=#><strong>Kourtney</strong></a>, now 39, <strong>Kim</strong>, 38, <a href=#><strong>Khloe</strong>,</a> 34, and <a href=#><strong>Rob</strong></a>, 31. Together, they had daughters <strong><a href=#>Kendall</a>,</strong> 23, and <a href=#><strong>Kylie</strong></a>, 21. (Robert Kardashian, an attorney, died from cancer in 2003.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/caitlyn-jenner-kim-kardashian.jpg><p>Caitlyn was quick to note she’s proud of her entire family. “All my kids have done extremely well,” the Secrets of My Life author explained on Tuesday. “They use that celebrity status, the show, and they build businesses.” She pointed to Kylie and Kendall, who were “like 8 and 9 years old” when KUWTK premiered in 2007.</p><p>“Everything went into a trust until they were 18,” Caitlyn revealed. “Kylie went out and started a cosmetics company. And Kendall wanted to be a model, that was her dream. In four years, she’s become the highest-paid in the world and works every day.”</p><p>Caitlyn even had kind words for her ex-wife. “Kris is very entrepreneurial,” she declared. “To say the least.”</p><p>Though Caitlyn expressed admiration for Kim, the two have had a umultuous past. In an October 2017 episode of KUWTK, Kim called Caitlyn a “liar” and “not a good person.” A month after the episode aired, Caitlyn revealed that she and the KKW Beauty founder had not spoken in a year. “They don’t want me in their lives, they bashed me pretty badly,” Caitlyn said during a talk at the Cambridge Union. “It’s devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt. I don’t know what the future holds. We will see.”</p><p>The athlete, who transitioned in 2015, is also the parent of <strong>Burt</strong>, 40, <strong>Cassandra</strong>, 38,<strong> Brandon</strong>, 37, and <a href=#><strong>Brody</strong></a>, 35, from previous relationships.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’ve been a lot closer to the Jenner side,” Caitlyn said on Tuesday. “My son Brandon, Brody somewhat, Burt, my daughter Casey, we’ve actually been really very good over the last few years.”</p><p>With reporting by Taylor Ferber</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacmZmpubq6jKOcp6aVp3qkrculqmajmaJ6rK3RnZisoJmWu26x162pnqWVocZuv8yaqa1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./boobie-bar-shark-tank-founder-net-worth-and-investment.html><span>←</span><span>Boobie Bar Shark Tank Founder, Net Worth, and Investment</span></a>
