During his acceptance speech at the NFL Honors on Saturday, Rodgers thanked his fiancée.</p><p>"2020 was definitely a crazy year filled with lots of change, growth, some amazing, memorable moments," he said during his speech. "One hundred-eighty straight days of having my nose hair scraped, a plan for very little fans or no stands the entire season, I got engaged, and I played some of the best football of my career."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Olivia Wilde & Harry Styles Are Reportedly Dating" href=#>Olivia Wilde & Harry Styles Are Reportedly Dating</a></span></p><p>Although the 37-year-old football player didn't mention Woodley by name, it has since confirmed that the couple are planning to tie the knot. A source told to E! Online, "They can't wait to get married and they want it to happen soon."</p><p>"They had a very intense connection from the beginning," the source added. "They both knew early on that it was something special and different from what they had experienced in other relationships. It's a quick engagement, but for those that know them, it didn't come as a surprise."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although their professions often keep them apart, Rodgers and Woodley reportedly spent the fall together. "She is very supportive of his career and embraced his life in Green Bay. Even though she has her own career and life, she wanted to be there with him. Over the next year, they plan to spend some time traveling and enjoying a warmer climate," the source said.</p><p>Before Rodgers announced the engagement, the couple kept their relationship under wraps. Earlier this month, a source told E! News that they wanted to keep "things private and low key." Before dating Woodley, Rodgers was in a <a href=#>relationship with race car driver Danica Patrick</a>. In July 2020, the couple called it quits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rodgers was also in a relationship with actress Olivia Munn for three years, but the couple broke up in 2017. Meanwhile, Woodley previously dated Australian-Fijian rugby player Ben Volavola in 2017. In April 2020, the relationship with Volavola was reported to have ended.</p><p>In September, Aaron spoke about his love life on the Pat McAfee Show, saying, "I've made decisions and changes and habits that put me in a lot better headspace and there's just a lot of things that have come together in my life over the last few months that have really been enjoyable. That's why I'm having so much fun and it starts with love. And then surrounding yourself with people that you really enjoy."</p><p>Source: <a href=#>EOnline</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Sharon Stone Has Had It With Dating" href=#>Sharon Stone Has Had It With Dating</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmiZkae8r3nRqJugnaKoeqa6xpqenpxdqbxuv8eaoKWdnpp6uLvOnaOesV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./britney-spears-spotted-driving-around-with-boyfriend-paul-soliz-after-reports-of-violent-fight.html><span>←</span><span>Britney Spears Spotted Driving Around With Boyfriend Paul Soliz After Reports Of Violent Fight</span></a>
