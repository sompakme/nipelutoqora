He was the 6th running back to be selected in that draft and the first of the three players selected from his college team that year. He was named the starting running back during the team’s 3rd&nbsp;preseason game against the&nbsp;Seattle Seahawks after&nbsp;Spencer Ware suffered a knee injury.</p><p>His first NFL appearance was in September in a game against&nbsp;the&nbsp;New England&nbsp;Patriots. Despite never fumbling during his college career, Kareem messed&nbsp;up&nbsp;his first&nbsp;professional&nbsp;career&nbsp;carry so that Patriot’s Devin McCourty had&nbsp;to go recover the ball. That notwithstanding, Hunt still finished that game with a total of two hundred and forty-six yards from scrimmage, the highest ever in an NFL debut.</p><p>In December, he was listed among the squad for the 2018 Pro Bowl&nbsp;as a rookie. He found his endzone for the third time in a row in week sixteen games against&nbsp;the Miami Dolphins where he rushed ninety-one yards and one touchdown. The following week, he emerged third in rushing yards behind&nbsp;Le’Veon Bell and&nbsp;Todd Gurley.</p><p>He is currently still playing for the City Chief.
