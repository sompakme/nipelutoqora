While producing "Big Little Lies" and "Mad Men," she also assisted in their post-production.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has also been credited as the producer for "The Big C" and "Sharp Objects." Her dad helped start the organization that her spouse now runs as CEO, Safe Water Network.</p><p>The producer pledged in August 2018 to carry on her father's work. Clea said her parents instilled in her and her siblings the importance of contributing to one's community and helping those less fortunate from an early age.</p><p>But what exactly did she inherit from her father to make that advocacy happen?</p><h2 id=why-paul-newman-almost-didn-rsquo-t-leave-any-money-to-his-kids>Why Paul Newman Almost Didn’t Leave Any Money To His Kids</h2><p>Paul's oldest daughter Susan claims her father made it clear he would not leave an inheritance to his kids because he thought having access to a large sum of money would make them irresponsible adults.</p><p>"When we were children, our father informed us there would be no inheritance. He said large sums of money eroded your ambition and mostly sabotaged your life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paul-newman-s-family.jpg><p>Susan elaborated by saying that she and her siblings accepted that, though they understood that it didn't rule out the possibility of financial support in the future.</p><p>She disclosed that when she was in her mid-30s, her father held a family meeting and promised to provide for his children. The actress claimed that Woodward Newman, her father's wife, played a role in his choice <a href=#>to leave them a portion of his estate</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Shaq Has Strict Rules For His Kids Before They Can Touch Their Inheritance</a></span></p><p>The "Hustler" star started giving his five daughters $30,000 apiece to donate to charities of their choosing in the hopes that they would <a href=#>continue in his philanthropic footsteps</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After his passing, the proud father intended to leave his daughters $500,000 each via separate foundations named Newman's Own Foundation.</p><p>His will and trust originally provided that half of his fortune would go to each of his children's foundations and the other half would go to Woodward, his wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Paul-Newman-and-his-wife-Joanne-Woodward.jpg><p>Newman had an estimated net worth of $80 million, as reported by Celebrity Net Worth. His estate is worth even more, approximately $600 million.</p><p>Let’s do some math. 50% of $600 million is $300 million, and if divided by six children, that would be a whopping $50 million for Claire Newman and her siblings. However, this is the full estimate of his estate, so the residual amount would entail a different number. But does it matter? Anything substantially rough of $50 million is still a ridiculously high amount.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=claire-olivia-newman-and-her-siblings-felt-betrayed-by-the-ceo-of-her-father-rsquo-s-foundation>Claire Olivia Newman And Her Siblings Felt Betrayed By The CEO Of Her Father’s Foundation</h2><p>When Paul's will was delivered at his funeral, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it contradicted everything</a> he and his advisers had said previously.</p><p>The majority of the promises made to the girls were broken. Bob Forrester, the CEO of the Newman's Own Foundation, said that their father had a change of heart, so it is unclear whether or not one or two girls will serve as board members on a revolving basis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-2.png><p>He claimed that Paul had never thought of Newman's Own as a family business. Instead, he was always thinking of the greater good. Forrester confirmed that at one point, Paul considered having one daughter serve a fixed-term appointment on each board.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Woodward's marital trust received the millions that were supposed to go to their charities. Additionally, the daughter's foundations would not receive money until after her passing to guarantee her proper care.</p><p>When they requested Forrester for more meetings, he reportedly became less and less engaging, giving them the impression that he had been given the keys to their father's fortune. "The keys had practically been given to one man, Bob Forrester," she said.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will Aaron Carter’s Family Challenge His Son's Inheritance?</a></span></p><p>Claire disclosed that prior to her father’s passing, Forrester gave numerous sermons emphasizing the importance of honesty. After Paul's death, however, everything else changed, and when she and her sisters questioned the shift, they were labeled as rude and argumentative.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-2.png><p>A flare-up allegedly occurred when they requested a meeting with him. After Forrester took over the foundation, he ordered all of the employees to keep quiet, making it difficult for the kids to get any information.</p><p>He subsequently admitted that nondisclosure agreements had been signed by employees, business partners, advisors, and board members. Before Claire and her siblings filed the will for probate, they contemplated asking for a 10-day postponement.</p><p>They consulted with several attorneys about the petition and concluded that asking for clarification on the alterations was not inappropriate. But Forrester was uncooperative, and he even warned Paul’s daughters that they risked being disinherited if they challenged the will.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1-2.png><p>Susan, the eldest child, believed it was her duty to carry out her father's wishes and protect his legacy because she was the keeper of his name.</p><p>Susan elaborated by saying that although her father's foundation is still a powerful force in the world of philanthropy, not everyone is convinced that it is carrying out Paul's original vision.</p><p>Despite all the back and forth, the true nature of his will may remain a mystery.
