He went on to become a lucrative movie star, but tension between him and the show arose after <a href=#><strong>David Spade</strong></a> joked about the Coming to America actor’s career in a 1995 sketch. “Look, children, it’s a falling star!” the Joe Dirt actor quipped following the releases of Murphy’s films Vampire in Brooklyn and Harlem Nights, which failed to win over the box office.</p><p>“What really irritated me about it at the time was that it was a career shot. It was like, ‘Hey, come on, man, it’s one thing for you guys to do a joke about some movie of mine, but my career?’” Murphy told Rolling Stone in 2011. “I’m one of you guys.”</p><p>The Nutty Professor star <a href=#>briefly returned to Saturday Night Live</a> in 2015 for the show’s 40th anniversary special. However, he did not take the Studio 8H stage by force again until December 2019, when he <a href=#>hosted an episode</a> that earned him his first Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.</p><p>“You don’t want to wait 30 years to come back and the show ain’t s—t,” Murphy told the <a href=#>Today show</a> ahead of his hosting gig. “It be like people clapping, going, ‘I thought he was going to be so much funnier than this.’”</p><p>The comedian’s return came amid a high point in his film career. “The timing couldn’t be better,” he said. “That’s why I feel like [I’m in] a dream.”</p><p>Murphy is not the only former cast member to make a major comeback on the long-running series. <a href=#><strong>Maya Rudolph</strong></a> ended her tenure in 2007 but <a href=#>returned</a> in 2019 to portray Vice President <a href=#><strong>Kamala Harris</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m so grateful always to be a part of that place, and then, when in my wildest dreams did I think there would ever be a candidate that looks remotely close to whatever this is?” Rudolph explained during an October 2020 appearance on <a href=#>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>. “I realize I started working there 21 years ago. How am I still standing? … I love it.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see where former Saturday Night Live stars are now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BorrXB0Z2YsmWenrSpwIyloK%2BdXajBor7SZq6hnaKaeqK%2BxGaroZ2pYruww44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oppenheimer-s-cillian-murphy-talks-perfect-florence-pugh-sex-scenes.html><span>←</span><span>Oppenheimer's Cillian Murphy Talks 'Perfect' Florence Pugh Sex Scenes</span></a>
