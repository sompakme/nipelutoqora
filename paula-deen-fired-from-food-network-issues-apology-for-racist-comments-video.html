The celebrity food expert found herself in hot water this week when she was accused of using the N-word and racial slurs by a former employee. Though the surprising <a href=# id=auto-tag_news_3 data-tag=news>news</a> ignited Twitter hashtags like #PaulaBestDishes and a “Paula Deen Bingo Game,” the <a href=# id=auto-tag_food-network_3 data-tag=food-network>Food Network</a> considered it no laughing matter. “Food Network will not renew Paula Deen’s contract when it expires at the end of this month,” says a press release issued by the network. The chef/ author issued not one, but two video apologies for her actions. In the first posted (and then deleted) statement, Paula begs for the forgiveness of her supporters. “I want to apologize to everybody for the wrong that I’ve done. I want to learn and grow from this. Inappropriate and hurtful language is totally, totally unacceptable. I’ve made plenty of mistakes along the way, but I beg you, my children, my team, my fans, my partners, I beg for your forgiveness. Please forgive me for the mistakes that I’ve made.” In the second, she does her best version of an apology, trying to convince the viewer that although she said those hurtful things, it isn’t a reflection of who she is. “I want people to understand that my family and I are not the kind of people that the press is wanting to say we are. I’ve spent the best of 24 years to help myself and others. Your color of your skin, your religion, your sexual preference does not matter to me … But it’s what’s in the heart. And my family and I try to live by that. And I am here to say I am so sorry. I was wrong. Yes, I’ve worked hard and I’ve made mistakes. But that is no excuse. And I offer my sincere apology to those that I have hurt. And I hope that you forgive me. Because this comes from the deepest part of my heart. And I will continue to work. And continue to do good things for good people. Thank you for listening.” Photo Credit: Getty</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6WutrjAZpuenZ5is6q%2BxJ1kn6efmXqvsdOwpqujXZ7AtMHErGSaqJ%2BhvKjFjKuYnKGjqXqku8ymnKeso2J%2Bd3%2BWaW5o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./monica-turner-s-biography-what-is-known-about-mike-tyson-s-ex-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Monica Turners biography: What is known about Mike Tysons ex-wife?</span></a>
