The statement, which stuck to facts, announced that he and Tori were going their separate ways.</p><p>However, according to multiple sources, Dean had already moved out of the former family home in advance of the announcement. As such, when Tori was spotted staying at a motel with their five kids, she told reporters that it was to protect her family from unsafe mold conditions at home.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Everything Tori Spelling Has Said About Her Marriage To Dean McDermott</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources hinted that given the apparently sorry state of Tori's credit, she couldn't manage to find a better place to stay. It's unclear whether she can't afford a rental or is having trouble finding a reasonable place; at this point, it's clear that Tori cannot afford typical Hollywood prices for a rental.</p><p>After leaving the motel, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tori and her kids were spotted staying in an RV</a> in Ventura County, but it is unclear whether that was a semi-permanent solution or where the RV was purchased, rented, or borrowed.</p><p>Because of her years of alleged overspending, it might be that Tori Spelling is unfortunately out of options when it comes to providing housing for her kids. Plus, given Dean McDermott's relative lack of projects (he used to act more frequently), it's unclear whether either party would be on the hook for any amount of child support.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet that didn't stop Dean's ex-wife from suing him for back child support in 2017; at the time, Mary Jo Eustace claimed that Dean and Tori lived in a $2 million home owned by Candy. Sadly for Tori, it doesn't seem that her mom was willing to help the family relocate due to mold issues in what is apparently her home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWkpL%2BqedKpnKWkmaO0brrErWSwp6KptW66xKCYraGmmnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-anthony-net-worth-how-much-is-anthony-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Anthony Net Worth How Much is Anthony Worth?</span></a>
