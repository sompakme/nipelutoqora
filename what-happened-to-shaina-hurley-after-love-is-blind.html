The show was full of drama, ranging from quick break-ups in Mexico to love triangles and wedding day turmoil. Fans could not get over the theatrics of one specific person, Shaina Hurley. Despite expressing feelings for Shayne Jansen, Hurley ended up engaged to Kyle Abrams. She called off her engagement to Abrams almost immediately and even appeared to have tried to break up Jansen and Natalie Lee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the show’s end, Hurley has been maintaining her theatric lifestyle. Though she was unable to find a husband on Love Is Blind, she has been successful in the real world. Shaina Hurley is now married! It is rather confusing, so let’s get into what Hurley’s life has been like since Love Is Blind.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How ‘Love Is Blind’ Star Shayne Jansen Feels About The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=shaina-hurley-is-friends-with-deepti-vempati><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Shaina Hurley Is Friends With Deepti Vempati</span></h2><p>Shaina Hurley did not give anyone the best first impression. After her time on season 2 of Netflix’s Love Is Blind, it is shocking anyone from the cast would want to spend time with Hurley. However, Hurley did post a photo of herself spending time with Deepti Vempati, but it is unclear how Deepti views their friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even more interesting is <a href=#>Deepti’s potential relationship with Hurley’s ex-fiancé, Kyle Abrams</a>. Hurley and Abrams were briefly engaged during their time on the show, but Abrams later revealed he wished he had proposed to Deepti. Hurley does not seem to be holding a grudge, so hopefully this does not affect her friendship with Deepti.</p><h2 id=who-is-shaina-hurley-dating><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Who Is Shaina Hurley Dating?</span></h2><p>Shaina Hurley did not waste any time moving on from Kyle Abrams. Their split on Love Is Blind was due to Hurley’s views on religion and she felt they were too different as people. Hurley found her match in the real world, though, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she went public with her relationship with Chris Lardakis</a> on March 13 of this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lardakis is Greek and is the founder and CEO of Kanela Breakfast Club. The company has four locations in the Chicago area, which is where Hurley is from. Lardakis also owns CL Development, which provides contract work and renovations.</p><h2 id=is-shaina-hurley-a-mom><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Is Shaina Hurley A Mom?</span></h2><p>Fans of Love Is Blind might not necessarily call Shaina Hurley maternal, but she has actually done an excellent job at her step-mother duties. Chris Lardakis has a daughter named Axelle from a former relationship. Hurley has spent a lot of time with Lardakis and his daughter, so maybe Hurley is not as immature as Love Is Blind made her seem.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Behind-The-Scenes Romances Of ‘Love Is Blind’ Season 2</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shaina-hurley-loves-self-improvement><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Shaina Hurley Loves Self-Improvement</span></h2><p>Love Is Blind had some very awkward moments, particularly when <a href=#>Shaina Hurley and Kyle Abrams were on screen</a>. Re-watching the show definitely gave Hurley something to reflect on, so it is no surprise she has been focusing on self-improvement.</p><p>Hurley has been very vocal about her work with a personal trainer. Living a healthier, calmer lifestyle has changed everything for Hurley. Spending time on herself as reshaped how she views herself and the rest of the world. She says she has never been happier!</p><h2 id=what-happened-during-the-love-is-blind-reunion><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Happened During The Love Is Blind Reunion?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shaina Hurley’s time on Love Is Blind was not well-received by fans. <a href=#>Hurley was dubbed one of the worst cast members in Love Is Blind history</a>, and her attitude was not ignored on during the reunion episode of the show’s second season.</p><p>Hurley was called out for her treatment of Kyle Abrams during their brief engagement. Abrams questioned why she accepted the proposal in the first place, considering she left Mexico early and did not seem interested in working through their problems. Natalie Lee also took issue with Hurley. Lee was upset with Hurley’s behavior around Shayne Jansen, claiming it was inappropriate considering Lee and Jansen’s engagement at the time.</p><h2 id=shaina-hurley-travelled-the-world><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Shaina Hurley Travelled The World</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The drama at the Love Is Blind reunion has not stopped Shaina Hurley from living her best life. With her boyfriend Chris Lardakis, Hurley travelled to Mykonos. Lardakis must have wanted to show Hurley a bit of his family history.</p><p>Photos from their trip can be seen on the couples’ Instagram accounts, and they look adorable together. Even though fans did not appreciate Hurley’s actions on Love Is Blind, they are still excited to see Hurley finally in a good, happy relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Love Is Blind’ Season 2 Cast’s Real-Life Careers</a></span></p><h2 id=shaina-hurley-engaged-to-chris-lardakis><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Shaina Hurley Engaged To Chris Lardakis</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were shocked to hear the news that after a year of dating, Shaina Hurley had gotten engaged to Chris Lardakis. The news was especially surprising considering it came only days after the couple had finally gone public. A source spoke of their engagement, saying “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this is the happiest I’ve ever seen her</a>. He has stood by her side through all of the Love Is Blind drama and has been her steady in the storm.”</p><p>It is suspected that Lardakis proposed to Hurley some time during their trip to Mykonos, though no ring can be seen in any of the photos the couple had shared of their time in Greece.</p><h2 id=is-shaina-hurley-married><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Is Shaina Hurley Married?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaina Hurley and Chris Lardakis are officially married</a>! On July 2 of this year, Hurley and Lardakis exchanged vows in a private courthouse ceremony. Only Lardakis’s daughter and a close friend were present. They chose to do this small ceremony so they could be legally married in the United States.</p><p>The newlyweds plan on having a big traditional wedding later this month in Greece. At the upcoming ceremony, more family and friends will attend to celebrate Hurley and Lardakis’s love. Congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. Lardakis!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Does The Cast Of ‘Love Is Blind’ Get Paid?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8br%2FHmqCnmV2dwrO4xLJkmp6kmr9uuM6vnGaho2KvrbXNnWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vicki-gunvalson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Vicki Gunvalson Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
