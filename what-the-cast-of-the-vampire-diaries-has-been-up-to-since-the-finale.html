That’s why it made so much sense for <strong><a href=#>The Vampire Diaries</a></strong>&nbsp;to premiere on The CW Network! TVD ran from 2009 to 2017 for eight seasons focusing on low triangles, action sequences, bloodthirst, eternal life, relationship turmoil, friendship loyalty, and a lot more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Did Nina Dobrev Really Like Playing Elena On ‘The Vampire Diaries’?</a></span></p><p class=p1>The show is classified as a drama, fantasy, and horror show although it doesn’t push the boundaries of being too scary. Here’s what the cast of the show has been up to since the show ended.</p><h2 id=ian-somerhalder><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ian Somerhalder</span></h2><p class=p1>Love and marriage happened for <a href=#>Ian Somerhalder</a> before his time on TVD came to an end. He married his wife, Nikki Reed, in 2015 which was two years before TVD concluded. They welcomed their first child into the world together in 2017:&nbsp;Bodhi Soleil Reed Somerhalder.&nbsp;It is special to watch their family growing and expanding. In 2019, he landed the leading role in another vampire TV series called V Wars. The sci-fi show only ran for one season despite the fact that Ian Somerhalder was doing a great job leading the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nina-dobrev><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Nina Dobrev</span></h2><p class=p1>Everyone knows that <a href=#>Nina Dobrev</a> parted ways with TVD before the show actually came to an end but she was such a pivotal part of the series that she is still considered one of the biggest names from the show. It was sad to see her leave the show and not finish things out until the very end but she had&nbsp;valid&nbsp;reasons. Mainly the fact that she used to date&nbsp;Ian Somerhalder&nbsp;and then he started dating Nikki Reed.&nbsp;It is really hard to work on set with an ex-boyfriend. She has been dating an Olympic snowboarder name Shaun White and she landed roles in movies like Dog Days and Then Came You in recent years.</p><h2 id=paul-wesley><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Paul Wesley</span></h2><p class=p1>The role of Stefan Salvatore was played by Paul Wesley flawlessly on TVD.&nbsp;He is an incredible actor who has even tried his hand at directing and working behind the scenes instead of always being the actor handling business in front of the camera.

Since TVD, he starred in a show called Tell Me a Story between 2018 and 2020.
