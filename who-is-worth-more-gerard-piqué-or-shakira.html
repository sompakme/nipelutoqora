Many are wondering what their combined net value is – including whom, between the ex-couple, has the higher net worth.</p><p><strong>Updated on March 28, 2023:</strong> Shakira and Gerard Piqué have been privately working out the details of their split over the last several months, as the couple officially called it quits in June 2022. It has recently been confirmed by Piqué himself that he has moved on... and with the woman that he had been rumored to have cheated on Shakira with.</p><p>Clara Chia Marti is 24 years old and fairly unknown, as she currently has less than <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">1500 followers on her Instagram page</a>, but Gerard has been romancing her nonetheless. It appears that Shakira may have moved on as well, with various sources revealing she spent time with a mystery man. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">One reporter shared</a>, "It seems the Colombian singer could have found a new illusion in the shape of a mysterious man she apparently met in Miami and has been in contact with for four months."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Shakira Is Confident In Her Innocence Amid Tax Fraud Scandal</a></span></p><h2 id=what-is-shakira-39-s-net-worth-now>What Is Shakira's Net Worth Now?</h2><p>Shakira has been a major icon in the music industry for so long that some people can’t even remember or were not around when she first became relevant as a singer. But it has been a long road for the star, who hails from Colombia, and she has worked hard to get to where she is today.</p><p>The Latin-pop sensation’s long and immersive career has lasted for decades and has garnered fame and respect from her fans around the world. Hailed as one of the best-selling artists of all time, she has accumulated a lot of wealth with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">net worth of $300 million</a>. With that in her treasure box, she is one of the richest stars in the industry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/shakira-4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to her extensive singing career, she has reached the pinnacle of success. Shakira boasts having million-dollar mansions, luxury cars, and even a private plane. She has won 3 Grammy Awards and 13 Latin Grammy Awards, and has sold more than 125 million albums and singles worldwide. That star has also signed on to be a judge for multiple seasons of The Voice, reportedly earning $12 million for that project.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Did Having Sasha Pique Mebarak Change Shakira's Career Forever?</a></span></p><p>She is also an executive producer and judge on a new NBC dance competition series Dancing With Myself. But despite all her successes, Shakira does not forget to give back to the community. She donates money to numerous causes that are close to her heart, and often makes headlines for this decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-is-gerard-piqu-eacute-worth-now>How Much Is Gerard Piqué Worth Now?</h2><p>As for Shakira's now ex-partner Gerard Piqué, his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">net worth reportedly stands at $80 million</a>. He accumulated his fortunes as a football player. Piqué started playing from a young age and became a part of FC Barcelona’s youth team, playing as a defensive midfielder. Before he was offered a spot in his home country, he made a move to Manchester United in 2004.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Gerard Piqué And Shakira's Relationship Had A Fiery End, But What Was The Start Of Their Love Story Like?</a></span></p><p>While he was on the team, Gerard often played as a substitute for players who had been injured. During his brief appearances on the field, he managed to impress everyone with his skills. He ended up having to juggle between Manchester United and Barcelona FC due to his popularity. He eventually returned to his native team in 2008, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, Gerard has participated in a number of contests and has emerged as one of the most well-known team members. He is considered a renowned Spanish footballer and one of the world’s best defenders. He reportedly earns a salary of $10 million, which contributes amply to his overall net worth of $80 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gerard-pique-and-shakira.jpg><p>Aside from his salary as an athlete, Gerard is also the founder and president of an investment group that signed a $3 billion partnership with the International Tennis Federation. With his investment company, he has purchased two Spanish football clubs: FC Andorra and Gimnàstic Manresa.</p><h2 id=who-makes-more-money-shakira-or-gerard>Who Makes More Money: Shakira Or Gerard?</h2><p>Without a doubt, Shakira has way higher net worth than her ex-partner Gerard Piqué. In fact, the pop star is reportedly willing to pay a part of the Barcelona defender and <a href=# rel=nofollow>former beau’s debt of $2.5 million</a> to keep custody of their children. She has even offered to pay him to visit the kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the detailed proposal, the singer suggested that she would pay for Gerard to travel first class five times to Miami every year. She has also promised she will let him spend every summer with their two kids. However, the football star refused the offer, as his overall personality suggests that he might feel disrespected by her offer of paying off his debts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/shakira-and-gerard-piqu.jpg><p>While the two have finally ended their romantic relationship, many are hoping that the ex-couple will resolve their custody battle peacefully and as soon as possible. As for their net worth, both are doing fine on the money front, so it is unlikely they would try to get funds from each other. Fortunately, they were also not married, so their individual wealth should stay intact after this split up — and they both have the potential to continue earning millions more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuw86rq6FlnaS%2FpnnGnqmaqpRivaq91J5kqKpdqLWit8irmGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-patrick-diter-business-fortune-wikipedia-bography-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Patrick Diter?
