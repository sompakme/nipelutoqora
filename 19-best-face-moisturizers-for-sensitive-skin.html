Us Weekly has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services. <a href=# rel><i>Learn more!</i></a></p><p>If you have sensitive skin, you’re likely used to carefully reading the ingredients list of all your personal care products. The smallest amount of certain ingredients can cause problems for men with sensitive skin. Ingredients like oils, parabens, chemicals and preservatives are all commonly found in skincare but can wreak havoc on sensitive skin.</p><p>Moreover, harmful ingredients that can potentially damage skin can even be absorbed into the body, making people more susceptible to health problems. Choosing the right face moisturizer for sensitive skin makes a big difference in both the health and appearance of your skin and your overall health. After all, what we put on our skin matters as much as what we put into our bodies.</p><p>Some people with sensitive skin may not even know the ingredients that can trigger a reaction like redness or irritation. That’s why many dermatologists and skin care experts recommend the patch test, a simple way to determine if ingredients in a new skincare product will activate your sensitive skin. Just use a small amount on your arm or leg or an area that can be covered if sensitivity occurs. Wait a few hours after application to see if any redness or issues develop; if so, you know this is a product to avoid.</p><p>Now that you know more about sensitive skin and how to keep it healthy, let’s look at the 19 best face moisturizers for sensitive skin.</p><h3>1. <a href=#>Blu Atlas Face Moisturizer</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image22.jpg><p>This anti-aging face moisturizer from Blu Atlas nourishes all skin types but is especially effective for sensitive skin.

If one or both of your parents have sensitive skin, it’s pretty likely you do. Genetics plays a role in our skin, from how it looks and its texture to how it reacts to certain ingredients and environmental factors. Rosacea is an example of this.</p><p>Rosacea is one of the most common sensitive skin conditions. That red, rosy cheek look that some people get when standing outside in cold weather or drinking a glass of wine is actually an genetic inflammatory skin condition. Factors like sun exposure, certain skincare ingredients, alcohol, caffeine, and even stress can worsen rosacea.</p><p>Sensitive skin is caused by nerve endings in the top layer of the skin becoming irritated. There are four types of sensitive skin: naturally sensitive, environmentally sensitive, reactive, and thin. Naturally sensitive skin is attributed to genetic factors. Environmentally sensitive skin is triggered by sun exposure, air pollution, and even pollen.</p><p>Anything your skin comes in contact with that can cause irritation. Reactive skin is sensitive to products, such as parabens, fragrances or chemicals commonly found in sunscreens. Finally, thin skin is sensitive because of natural causes like aging, where the skin’s layers become less dense over time.</p><p>How do you know if you have sensitive skin? Dermatologists and skin care experts agree that sometimes it can be difficult to define sensitive skin. In general, sensitive skin is more reactive than usual. You may notice your skin feeling tight, excessively dry, or stinging after applying some moisturizers, cleaners, sunscreen, or serums. Any time you notice a negative reaction in your skin after any part of your skincare routine, your skin is becoming sensitive.</p><p>The evidence is visible for those with skin sensitivity and conditions like acne, rosacea and psoriasis. Redness, pimples, dry areas with red bumps, and even raised areas of skin with gray or silver scales mean that skin is sensitive and usually requires topical treatment. Most people with sensitive skin can clear their skin condition at home. In general, sensitive skin can be maintained by knowing its triggers and avoiding those ingredients that lead to reactions.</p><h2>Needing Nourishment</h2><p>Sensitive skin requires more attention than other skin types. Protecting the skin from outside elements and also strengthening the skin’s barrier through gentle cleansing and hydration is important. Coating and soothing the skin with gentle moisturizers like glycerin, aloe, or colloidal oatmeal helps sensitive skin stay hydrated and avoid irritation. The fewer ingredients and the more natural ingredients in your moisturizer, the better.</p><p>Experts advise if you have sensitive skin to be cautious when trying new moisturizers or skincare products. Even if you don’t normally have sensitive skin, certain products can cause allergic reactions. When choosing a moisturizer, look for ingredients that will not only hydrate and protect the skin but soothe it as well. Ingredients like ceramides form a protective barrier on the skin. Also consider moisturizers that are lightweight, non-greasy, and ideally, fragrance-free.</p><h2>What to Avoid</h2><p>There are quite a few ingredients people with sensitive skin should avoid. Using products with fragrance or heavy oils like nut oils or shea butter can cause clogged pores, leading to irritation. It’s also best to steer clear of chemical ingredients like sulfates or harsh physical exfoliants, like apricot kernels or plastic microbeads found in many facial scrubs. And while glycolic and salicylic acids and retinoids are great for helping skin look younger, many people are sensitive to those ingredients, so be cautious when using them for the first time.</p><p>How you apply your skincare matters just as much as what you apply. Your skincare routine should be gentle when you have sensitive skin. Avoid rubbing, scrubbing, or washing too often. Harsh scrubs and vigorous rubbing cause skin irritation through tiny micro-tears in the skin. And overwashing can strip skin of its natural moisture barrier and make it susceptible to irritation and environmental factors like sun, wind, and cold.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOm5ysrF2brqSxjKamoqukqr%2BqxsSrqmarlaPAqsDIr5xmq5ueu3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-little-known-facts-about-adele-and-rich-paul-s-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>10 Little Known Facts About Adele And Rich Paul's Relationship</span></a>
