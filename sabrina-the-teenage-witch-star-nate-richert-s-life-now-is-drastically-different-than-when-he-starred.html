The '90s sitcom about a teenager discovering that she has magical powers is as adorable today as it always was.

From hobbies to his love of playing music to the enjoyment he still seems to have thinking about the '90s sitcom, there are a lot of interesting things to know about the actor.</p><h2 id=nate-richert-became-a-musician-after-sabrina-the-teenage-witch><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Nate Richert Became A Musician After Sabrina The Teenage Witch</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nate-richert-singing-guitar.jpg><p>It seemed like Nate Richert was going to become a super famous actor while appearing on Sabrina The Teenage Witch as Harvey. <a href=#>Melissa Joan Hart's acting career after Sabrina</a> included many other shows, after all, including Melissa And Joey. But Richert has become a musician in the years since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He often posts about the music that he's making on his Instagram and also shared that he performs at open mics sometimes. Fans can check out his music on his website, including the video he made for his song "Let Me Be Your Fool."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nate Richert talked about his music</a> and told Revamp Magazine, "I love songwriting. It’s something that I started while on the show because, for portions of the day, when they don’t need you, you end up sitting in your trailer."</p><h2 id=nate-richert-does-public-appearances-for-sabrina-the-teenage-witch><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Nate Richert Does Public Appearances For Sabrina The Teenage Witch</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sabrina-the-teenage-witch-cast.jpg><p>When Sabrina The Teenage Witch was on the air, Nate Richert's star was rising. Now that he's well-known for playing this part, he seems to interact with fans of the '90s sitcom as much as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In March 2023, Richert shared that he and his fellow cast members were at '90s Con. It looks like it was a lot of fun and like he enjoyed spending time with his co-stars again. Richert posted a photo with Jenna Leigh Green, who played the school bully Libby, and wrote, "Another one of my favorite people. This 'mean girl' always brightens the room."</p><h2 id=while-nate-richert-is-famous-from-sabrina-he-lives-a-regular-life-now><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>While Nate Richert Is Famous From Sabrina, He Lives A Regular Life Now</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nate-richert-friend-pizza-1.jpg><p>Even though everyone knows Nate Richert as Harvey Kinkle and he still is in the spotlight, he isn't as famous as some other former '90s stars. And he seems to live a totally regular life that he really likes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did This Episode Of Sabrina The Teenage Witch Cross A Line?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans who follow him on Instagram saw him post about a "pizza night" that he enjoyed with some friends. He showed the process of putting toppings on dough and posted him and his friend looking thrilled with what they had created.</p><h2 id=nate-richert-seems-to-like-adventurous-activities-such-as-skydiving><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Nate Richert Seems To Like Adventurous Activities Such As Skydiving</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nate-richert-skydiving.jpg><p>It can be hard not to think that an actor is exactly like the TV character they play. If Harvey Kinkle was ever asked if he would try skydiving, he would probably shrug, laugh, and look a bit awkward. He isn't the most adventurous person around. But he might support Sabrina if she decided that she wanted to do it.</p><p>In real life, Nate Richert seems to enjoy skydiving. He posted a photo of him jumping out of a plane a few years ago. It was fun and (perhaps nerve-wracking, depending on how people feel about heights) to see his picture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nate-richert-does-several-jobs-besides-acting><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Nate Richert Does Several Jobs Besides Acting</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nate-richert-smiling.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nate Richert shared that he has jobs</a> that don't have anything to do with acting. According to Entertainment Tonight, he said, "I’ve been an actor for 32 yrs (since age 8). I’m extremely lucky to have had any success at all, let alone solid work in film and TV for 6 yrs (20 yrs ago)."</p><p>The actor continued, I’m currently a maintenance man, a janitor, a carpenter, and do whatever random jobs I can get to pay the bills. I do improv and songwrite to maintain my sanity. Actors so very rarely have job security or consistent work, quality healthcare, a reasonable retirement."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nate-richert-likes-woodworking-and-embracing-his-handy-side><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Nate Richert Likes Woodworking And Embracing His Handy Side</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nate-richert-bow-tie-1.jpg><p>Like many other celebrities, Nate Richert posted on his Instagram account in 2020, and updated his fans on what he was up to during the COVID-19 pandemic. In one post from December 2020, he said that he was woodworking.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Sabrina The Teenage Witch' Reunion: Everything Former Stars Revealed About The Show</a></span></p><p>Richert wrote, "Apple boxes are a film set staple.

He said that he figured out how to live with this and be able to be happier.</p><p>The actor said, "Anxiety and subsequent depression were my major game-stoppers. Took a decade to learn how to cope and overcome. Back then, all I knew was something was wrong with me, that I was broken and unworthy; all that fantastic BS anxiety likes to ruin your life with. But it didn’t."</p><h2 id=nate-richert-has-only-starred-in-a-few-other-movies-and-tv-shows><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Nate Richert Has Only Starred In A Few Other Movies And TV Shows</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nate-richert-guitar.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of Sabrina The Teenage Witch loved watching Richert as Sabrina's sweet boyfriend Harvey and know that he's really talented. In the years after the sitcom, he starred in a few movies, including Gamebox 1.0 in 2004 and Pinata: Survival Island in 2003. He also guest-starred in a few TV episodes like Touched By An Angel in 2000 and Fantasy Island in 1998.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is What Caroline Rhea From 'Sabrina The Teenage Witch' Is Doing Now</a></span></p><p>Richert alluded to how his mental health made it tough for him to think that he could act once he was done playing Harvey. It seems like he is really happy making music and doing public appearances. And he will act more in the future.</p><h2 id=nate-richert-uses-cameo-often-and-fans-can-order-videos><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Nate Richert Uses Cameo Often And Fans Can Order Videos</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nate-richert-coffee-mug.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in the '90s, Nate Richert would have likely interacted with fans of Sabrina The Teenage Witch by mail. Maybe they found a way to write to his publicist or manager and ask for a signed photo. These days, he interacts with his fanbase by Cameo.</p><p>Fans of the sitcom and of Richert's character Harvey should definitely order a video message for themselves or for a friend or relative.</p><h2 id=nate-richert-and-malorie-felt-got-married-in-2019><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Nate Richert And Malorie Felt Got Married In 2019</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nate-richert-driving.jpg><p>According to Us Weekly, Nate Richert and Malorie Felt had a wedding in 2019. No longer being single would have definitely been a big change for the Sabrina The Teenage Witch actor.</p><p>Richert doesn't talk about his wife on Instagram, however, or put up any photos of her on social media. He might not want to share that part of his life and it's possible that he's more comfortable talking about the good times he had playing Harvey Kinkle on Sabrina The Teenage Witch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8br%2FAm6mippFiwamxjK2cnqaRnLJuw8itmqFlo6mus3nNmqueZaKesKmx0a2qaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-coolidge-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Coolidge Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
