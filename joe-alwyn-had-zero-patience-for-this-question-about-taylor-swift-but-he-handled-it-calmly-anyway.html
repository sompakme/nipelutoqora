Their relationship lasted for six years, and during that time they did their best to avoid uncomfortable and unwanted attention. Although they weren't always successful, they managed surprisingly well.</p><p>Perhaps it was this desire for privacy that challenged interviewers to relate any topic to their relationship. That's how Joe Alwyn found himself having to answer an unusual question in an interview last year with his <a href=#>Conversations With Friends co-star Alison Oliver</a>. The London’s Royal Central School of Speech & Drama, who appeared on several huge projects and has proved his talent again and again, dodged this question with class, but that doesn't mean it isn't annoying to see him treated as just a plus one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-alwyn-and-taylor-swift-39-s-relationship-has-kind-of-outshined-his-work>Joe Alwyn And Taylor Swift's Relationship Has Kind Of Outshined His Work</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/joe-alwyn-may-be-a-completely-different-man-after-breaking-up-with-taylor-swift-here-s-the-truth-about-his-mysterious-life-now.jpg><p>Taylor Swift's relationship with Joe Alwyn caught the world's attention for pretty much its entire duration. It was first made public in 2017, and following it being reported, Taylor shared that they had been together for a few months before anyone found out.</p><p>After that, they were put under a microscope, with the media documenting every new step their relationship took, every time they were seen in public, and interpreting any gesture as proof that they were getting married. Plenty of engagement rumors were spread, denied each and every time, and all things considered, they managed to stay fairly private for the six years they spent together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor knew from past experiences that being as careful as possible with her love life was necessary for her peace of mind. Joe, for his part, didn't want his career to forever come second to his relationship.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Vogue UK</a>, he made it clear he wouldn't talk about Taylor in public if he could avoid it. "I’m aware people want to know about that side of things. I think we have been successfully very private, and that has now sunk in for people. But I really prefer to talk about work."</p><p>He also said that, although it was challenging, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he knew how to handle it</a> from the beginning. "I know what I feel about it. I think there’s a very clear line as to what somebody should share, or feel like they have to share, and what they don’t want to and shouldn’t have to."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Went Wrong?

Although Joe Alwyn is primarily an actor, he's also a talented musician, and Taylor liked to collaborate with him every now and then.</p><p>On her albums Folklore, Evermore, and even Midnights, the last album before their relationship publicly ended, <a href=#>a man named William Bowery appears credited in a few songs</a>. It was later revealed that it was Joe's pseudonym.</p><p>It wouldn't be the first time Taylor collaborated on <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> with her partners, but their songwriting partnership seemed to extend for longer than all the others.</p><h2 id=joe-alwyn-was-asked-a-weird-question-about-taylor-swift>Joe Alwyn Was Asked A Weird Question About Taylor Swift</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Star-Of-Conversations-With-Friends-Is-Brand-New-To-Hollywood.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2022, Joe Alwyn had a huge break in his career when he got the lead role in the TV adaptation of Sally Rooney's novel Conversations With Friends. The 12-episode series brought him a lot of attention, and while he was glad to have people praise his acting talents, it also caused the media and fans to focus on his relationship with Taylor Swift.</p><p>At some point, the kind of questions steered too much from his work and focused on her and their relationship, which he wasn't happy about, but also seemed to know how to handle gracefully. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor's opinion about his new project came up a lot</a>, and he would always give a polite, measured answer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Joe Alwyn Really Date Emma Laird After His Brutal Breakup With Taylor Swift?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She’s a big fan of Sally’s writing and loved the book, like I did, so she was equally thrilled when I got the part," he said when he was asked about what she thought of him getting this role. "Like anyone, we talk about work and life and everything, that’s part of being with someone. And it’s a great part of being with someone."</p><p>However, there was one interviewer who asked a question about Taylor that kind of caught him off guard. He was able to answer anyway, but his discomfort and impatience were evident.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Someone asked him</a> whether he asked Taylor Swift to "cover her eyes" whenever a "steamy" scene came up, which seemed to confuse him. He gave a noncommittal answer, saying that she was a fan of the story, so no, obviously she didn't cover her ears.</p><p>Thankfully, the line of questions moved on, but it was a weird moment.</p><h2 id=since-the-split-joe-alwyn-has-stayed-busy>Since The Split, Joe Alwyn Has Stayed Busy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/untitled-design-2023-09-11t125441-584.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it's truly sad that Joe and Taylor's romance ended, people shouldn't feel too bad for Joe. Although not many people might know this, he's actually had a very successful career in his field, and now he might be able to explore it without constantly getting asked if he's about to propose.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Joe Alwyn And Taylor Swift Bought A Massive Mansion Before Splitting Up: Where Does Joe Live Now?</a></span></p><p>In 2018, Joe played a supporting role in the multiple award-winning film The Favourite, which allowed him to work alongside the Oscar winner Olivia Colman. He also played a key role in Harriet, a biographical drama about abolitionist Harriet Tubman.</p><p>As if that wasn't enough, Joe Alwyn had a brief stint as a model as well. In 2017, he became the face of Prada's menswear campaign and proved to the world that he had yet another hidden talent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it's true that his relationship with Taylor Swift was a big part of his life, and it was never the singer's fault that she sometimes outshined him, as an audience, we shouldn't let their time together define him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqJ1dlrm4xc1mn5qcXa%2Bys7uMqZitoZWjsKZ5xaipZqyYnsBuvdSeqq2hn6N6oq7OrqtmrJGuubC%2BjKyuop6kZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jenna-lyons-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Jenna Lyons Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
