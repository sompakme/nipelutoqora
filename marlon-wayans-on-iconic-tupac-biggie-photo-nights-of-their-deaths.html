So Pac was out performing at Glam Slam, which was Prince’s old club downtown, and Biggie was performing that night.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“So that night, I met Biggie and Pac, and they shared the stage. And they were really cool and hanging out and smoking weed together, it was a great night,” recalled the New York native. “And then, a couple of years after that,<a href=#> they started beefing</a>. So I seen Biggie at the VIBE Magazine party and he was like, ‘Yo, I’m proud of you guys, your family. I like what y’all doing, y’all legends.’ And he gave us dap or whatever and he said, ‘Keep doing what you’re doing, kid.” And then 10 minutes later, I heard [imitates gunshots]… Biggie gets shot.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The White Chicks star then revealed that he also experienced an eerily similar encounter with 2Pac months prior, on the very night the rapper was murdered in Las Vegas.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Here’s the crazy thing,” Wayans begins. “I see 2Pac in Vegas at The Luxor, and it was the night it happened to him. I saw him 20 minutes before [and] went and gave him a hug, said, ‘I love you brother, good seeing you.’ Me and Omar got in a cab. Pac had all those people around him, he got in his BMW, and he was looking at us like, ‘I wish I could get in that cab with y’all,’ but he got in that BMW. 20 minutes later, he was shot.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After joking that the hosts could suffer a similar fate due to being in his presence, Marlon further reflects on being present for such a historic moment. “It’s crazy ’cause I’m sitting there, watching the both of ’em in the background of that picture,” he added. “I love ’em both, miss ’em both.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Marlon Wayans is currently <a href=#>promoting his new </a>Netflix film, The Curse of Bridge Hollow, which will be available to stream on the platform on Friday (Oct. 14).</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch Marlon Wayans share the stories on The Late Late Show with James Corden below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Kus7jOp2SwmamWu7R5kamYnGWSnrSotcRmoJynnp6wbrzInKuuqpVifnN%2Fk3BnaW5kbXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cade-cunningham-height-salary-net-worth-contract-position-age-instagram-family-siblings-jer.html><span>←</span><span>Cade Cunningham Height, Salary, Net Worth, Contract, Position, Age, Instagram, Family, Siblings, Jer</span></a>
