Historically, they were built simply for purpose; they are now being built for pleasure and comfort. With amenities such as administrative offices and training facilities, NFL stadiums are complete destinations for a team. While built primarily for football, today’s stadiums also accommodate a wide range of activities, from other sporting events, music concerts, and even government conventions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With their massive construction costs, stadiums are generally funded by the public, and must undergo an approval process.&nbsp; In the case of Ford Field, approval was especially needed, since the stadium features more sunlight than any other NFL stadium, and thus constituted a playing distraction. The only exception to the approval process was Metlife Stadium, the most expensive NFL stadium ever built, which was constructed primarily on private funding.</p><p>NFL stadiums are a testament not only to America’s love affair with football, but also to technical and architectural progress. For example, AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys, has been built with a massive LED screen. Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia includes Wi-Fi for visitors to the stadium. Paul Brown Stadium, in Cincinnati, Ohio, has been recognized as an architectural masterpiece, making in onto “America’s Favorite Architecture”. A few stadiums, such as Soldier Field and Lucas Oil Stadium, are tributes to former players and America’s vets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sponsorships of pro athletes are lucrative and stadium naming rights are no exception.&nbsp; Many of the stadiums on this list are named after a corporate sponsor, which secures the necessary funding required for maintenance and/or renovation. As new stadiums are being constructed, ticketing and concession prices have also increased. Many NFL stadiums, such as AT&T Stadium, have some of the highest prices for parking and programs in all of sports.</p><p>Ultimately, NFL stadiums have become more than just a place to watch sports.&nbsp; They have become centers where adults and children can go to be entertained.</p><h2 id=10-university-of-phoenix-stadium---construction-cost-527-million><strong>10. University of Phoenix Stadium - Construction Cost: $527 million</strong></h2><p>Located in Glendale, Arizona, University of Phoenix Stadium is the home of the Arizona Cardinals. &nbsp;Construction began April 12, 2003, and lasted three years. The stadium has hosted various events including Super Bowl XLII and the 2011 BCS National Championship Game, which it hosts every four years. With a seating capacity of 63,400, the stadium was built for a cost of $527 million.&nbsp; Stadium facilities include 14,000 on-site parking spaces and a movable field. &nbsp;For tailgating activities, there is an eight-acre area called the Great Lawn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-sports-authority-field-at-mile-high---construction-cost-528-million><strong>9. &nbsp;Sports Authority Field at Mile High - Construction Cost: $528 million</strong></h2><p>Sports Authority Field at Mile High hosts Denver Broncos home games, and was built for $528 million. &nbsp; Although used primarily for football games, it also hosts Denver's Lacrosse team, the Denver Outlaws.

Ford Field's attendance record was set in April 1, 2007 when it hosed the World Wrestling Entertainment's Wrestlemania 23.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-centurylink-field---construction-cost-558-million><strong>7.&nbsp;CenturyLink Field - Construction Cost: $558 million</strong></h2><p>Previously known as Qwest Field, CenturyLink is the home of the Seattle Seahawks.
