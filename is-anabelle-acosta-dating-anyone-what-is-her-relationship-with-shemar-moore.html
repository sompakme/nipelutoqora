<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Is Anabelle Acosta Dating Anyone, What Is Her Relationship With Shemar Moore?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>There is no shortage of beautiful women in Hollywood and Anabelle Acosta definitely makes the cut. The Cuban-born actress first graced our screens in 2008, with small roles in the movies&nbsp;The Next Hit&nbsp;and Freelancers. Since then her roles have been few and far between. It was not until 2015 that the actress got some recognition with her being cast as the character Annabella in the American drama TV series&nbsp;Ballers&nbsp;opposite Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson. In that same year, her popularity got a major boost when she joined the cast of&nbsp;Quantico&nbsp;and was given a main role.</p><p>As with any celebrity in the public eye, there’s been a lot of speculation and wild guesses as to whom the actress is dating. Grab some popcorn while we take a look into the life and love interests of Anabelle Acosta.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life-and-career></span><strong>Early Life and Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born in Havana, Cuba on the 28th of February 1987 to Cuban-American parents, Acosta was briefly raised in the Carribean Island country with younger brother Jason before the family&nbsp;moved and settled in Queens, New York.</p><p>Anabelle Acosta attended The Julliard School where she trained in theatre and dance. After graduation, she remained in New York to pursue a career in acting and modeling. She was more successful in the modeling department and booked several advertising gigs. Acting roles&nbsp;were hard to come by but she still continued to audition until she was cast as a bartender in the movie&nbsp;The Next Hit. The role wasn’t much, but it was a long-awaited start to her career.</p><p>However, the next two years did not see Acosta on screen until 2011. She continued to be cast in inconsequential roles until she appeared in&nbsp;Ballers in 2015. She had a recurring role, playing the girlfriend of one of the show’s characters and appearing in seven episodes.</p><p>Later that year, Acosta also got to join the cast of&nbsp;Quantico&nbsp;alongside Priyanka Chopra. She was cast as the character Natalie Vasquez, an FBI recruit who, along with other team members formed an anti-terrorist squad. She only spent a year on the show as her character was eventually killed.</p><p>Her other film&nbsp;appearances include&nbsp;By the Gun (2014) and Fat Camp (2017). While Anabelle Acosta is yet to land that big role on the silver screen,&nbsp;she continues to prove herself as one tough cookie in the industry.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-anabelle-acosta-dating-anyone-what-is-her-relationship-with-shemar-moore></span><strong>Is Anabelle Acosta Dating Anyone, What Is Her Relationship With Shemar Moore?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anabelle Acosta’s love life has constantly made for juicy gist on different tabloids since her advent into popularity. The&nbsp;Ballers&nbsp;star has been linked to Wiz Khalifa, Dwayne Johnson, and currently&nbsp;Shemar Moore.</p><p>In January of 2014, Acosta and Johnson were pictured kissing on the set of their TV series&nbsp;Ballers.&nbsp;The kiss sparked dating rumors between Acosta and her co-star, but others speculated that the kiss may have been staged as a publicity stunt for the show. Johnson, who has since 2007 been divorced from his wife, neither confirmed nor denied that he was dating his co-star. The rumors fizzled out when no further news or pictures about the duo popped up.</p><p>Another relationship rumor that held no weight was that of Acosta and musician Wiz Khalifa. In June 2015, the couple was spotted together on the red carpet at the premiere of the TV series&nbsp;Entourage.&nbsp;The media claimed that Khalifa had brought Acosta to the premiere as his date, however, she shot down the rumors herself with a message posted on her Instagram. In the post, she claimed to be single and that she and Khalifa were not an item.</p><p>Fast forward to January 2018, and Acosta and former&nbsp;Criminal Minds actor, Shemar Moore, were spotted together on another red carpet. This time around, it was the Grammys and Acosta was not rushing to her social media to make any post-red carpet posts about not being involved with Moore.</p><p>In an interview with Steve Harvey, Moore revealed that he persuaded Acosta to go out on a date with him and that their Grammys appearance together was actually that first date. In the interview, Moore pretty much confirmed that the two of them were in a relationship and that they were taking it slow and working on just getting to know each other better at the moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYq6vrcGeo6WdXZawsL%2FTmmSdmaSeu6h5wKewqKaVYsSprdNmoKxlmJq%2Fbr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2auoqyYYsCpscyaqWaln6S%2FpnmRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inside-jason-alexander-and-his-wife-daena-e-title-relationship-timeline.html><span>←</span><span>Inside Jason Alexander And His Wife Daena E.
