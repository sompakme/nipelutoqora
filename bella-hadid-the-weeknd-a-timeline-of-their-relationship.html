Stepping into 2018, it seems like the two are giving their loving relationship another shot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In order to celebrate the end of the off-era of this famous singer-model couple, here is&nbsp;a trip down memory lane:</p><p><strong>April 2015</strong></p><p>The two first met and clicked at Coachella 2015, where The Weeknd performed. The then-18-year-old Bella and 24-year-old The Weeknd were seen flirting, and it didn't hurt that Hadid loves his music as well. Ever since then, they had many double dates with Bella’s sister Gigi Hadid and her then-boyfriend Australian pop star <a href=#>Cody Simpson</a>.</p><p><strong>May 2015</strong></p><p>The Weeknd hinted at their relationship in one of his Twitter posts:</p><p><strong>June - July 2015</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Gigi Hadid</a> was one of the presenters at the 2015 Much Music Video Awards in Toronto. She handed The Weeknd his award for Artist of the Year. Bella posted a photo of the two kissing on the cheek to her Instagram with no caption, but she took it down. Her sister also shared a photo of her and The Weeknd backstage, calling him "brother."</p><p>This might not be an enough of a confirmation, but rumors spread even faster. It certainly looked like The Weeknd had Bella's sister approval and support.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>THE WEEKND & BELLA HADID SPOTTED TOGETHER AT COACHELLA</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>August- September 2015</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple officially let the world know that they were dating. The pair was seen alternately in New York and Los Angeles in summer and early fall of 2015. They attended fashion week together, went on double-dates with Gigi and her beau <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Jonas</a>, and The Weeknd bought Bella an adorable Yorkie named Hendrix for her nineteenth birthday!</p><p><strong>October - December 2015</strong></p><p>Their relationship took on a creative&nbsp;form in December as&nbsp;Hadid finally agreed to star in The Weeknd's music video In the Night. We don't know for sure if&nbsp;she was an inspiration behind the lyrics, but based on what we know about the young and fearless model who took the world by storm while&nbsp;battling&nbsp;Lyme Disease, the part where The Weeknd sang "she's capable of anything" definitely can be linked to his girlfriend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The end of December 2015 came with the news that the two were "taking a break" from their relationship because of their busy schedules. Bella was spending Christmas with her family while The Weeknd was busy dropping two new songs.</p><p><strong>January - May 2016</strong></p><p>The couple made public appearances&nbsp;at multiple events so it looked like they&nbsp;worked through whatever rift there was.&nbsp;Hadid was there to support the Weeknd at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2016 Grammy Award</a> because it was an important night for him. He was there for her and helped her deal with all the pre-show jitters at the Daily Front Row’s Fashion Los Angeles awards. They were also inseparable at Coachella 2016. The two also attended the annual MET gala party together in matching black ensembles from the house of Givenchy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>October - November 2016</strong></p><p>The Weeknd asked his girlfriend to join him on a well-deserved vacation in order to celebrate her 20th birthday. They flew to Tokyo and spent some time exploring the city. Key moments of the trip were captured and shared by both to their fans on Instagram.</p><p>But another split happened again because of their crazy schedule. The Weeknd finished his album Starboy and he went on tour to promote it. Two weeks after the couple broke up, they reunited again on Victoria's Secret annual runway. The Weeknd performed his hit while his ex-girlfriend walked past him in dreamy silk and lace creation. The situation tugged hearts of fans who adore the couple, but&nbsp;Hadid assured fans that there was no awkwardness between the two.</p><p><strong>RElATED: <a href=#>THE WEEKND & BELLA HADID SPOTTED TOGETHER AT COACHELLA</a></strong></p><p><strong>January 2017</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Weeknd was seen hanging out with <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> outside Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica. By hanging out, we mean they kissed and their hands were all over each other. The series of photos were eventually taken down, but they were there up long enough to inspire Bella Hadid to unfollow TheWeeknd on Instagram. It's understandable because Gomez and the Hadid sisters were friends, so this must have felt like a stab in the back to Hadid.</p><p><strong>February- June 2011</strong></p><p>The Weeknd and Selena publicly announced their relationship. A few days later, Hadid finally admitted&nbsp;she didn't handle her break up as well as she portrayed to the world.</p><p>Selena and The Weeknd made their red carpet debut at 2017 MET gala together in May. Bella, on the other hand, took all the spotlight to herself while wearing a skintight, dazzling and revealing catsuit by Alexander Wang. Some said that she had her revenge on the red carpet by looking stunning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In early June, despite&nbsp;unfollowing each other on Instagram,&nbsp;Hadid briefly liked then unliked a photo of The Weeknd's Forbes cover. This action, of course, didn't go unnoticed by expecting fans.</p><p><strong>October 2017</strong></p><p>Gomez and the Weeknd broke up after 10 months of dating. On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen</a>, Yolanda Hadid said that her daughter Bella was over The Weeknd dating Selena Gomez. She was also surprised that people think Bella was dating Drake. Drake threw Bella an epic 21st birthday party and sources told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> that they hooked up. The Weeknd was reportedly to be very mad because Drake broke the bro-code.</p><p><strong>November - December 2017</strong></p><p>One night in November, The Weeknd was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photographed</a> getting out of Bella's apartment in New York City. Earlier that day, Bella was also spotted in The Big Apple. Fearing another heartbreak, Bella's family was reportedly telling her to slow down.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>BELLA HADID & THE WEEKND SPOTTED TOGETHER AGAIN</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>March - May 2018</strong></p><p>The Weeknd's&nbsp;surprise&nbsp;album, My Dear Melancholy featured six songs that mostly told the story of how his relationship with&nbsp;Gomez went.&nbsp; The song "Call Out My Name" stirred up the rumors that The Weeknd still had strong feelings for Bella, and dating&nbsp;Gomez was just a waste of his time.</p><p>Coachella 2018 came with the rumor that Bella and The Weeknd secretly spent time in each other's company. There were also pictures of them kissing. Bella commented on the post that it wasn't her in the photo.</p><p>The couple got seriously cozy at this year Cannes Film Festival. Backstage, people spotted them kissing, sitting next to each other and clearly enjoying each other company to the fullest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of May 2018, the couple was spotted in public in Paris. They shared a cozy walk and a romantic dinner, from which fans can see that the model and the singer are very happy to be back in each other's life. Just a few days later, Bella and The Weeknd seemingly took to Instagram to confirm their relationship. The Weeknd uploaded a picture of a female's hand, holding a package of sugar which read "Sugar Daddy."</p><p>A few hours later, Bella shared a photo of her during an interview. Eagle-eyed fans quickly notice that the nails from Abel's picture and from Hadid's post of herself look alike. As many A-list celebrities, they haven't made any verbal or written confirmation of their relationship yet. But, we believe that it's safe to say the two lovebirds reconciled.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>THE WEEKND&nbsp;& BELLA HADID SPOTTED IN PARIS LOOKING LIKE THEY'RE MORE THAN FRIENDS</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nkpq5ra2MoZidoZRixKaxyqebZqyZorKttc2eZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beauty-and-the-beast-shop-belle-s-stunning-gold-branch-necklace.html><span>←</span><span>'Beauty and the Beast': Shop Belle's Stunning Gold Branch Necklace</span></a>
