A <strong>Wu-Tang Clan</strong> representative released a statement to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> Friday, April 18, regarding rapper <strong>Andre Johnson</strong>, who severed his penis before jumping from an L.A. apartment building in a suicide attempt on Wednesday.</p><p>"I feel terrible for what happened to Andre Johnson," Wu-Tang publicist <strong>Heathcliff Berry </strong>tells <strong>Us</strong>. "I hope he finds peace and gets the help that he needs," Berry adds, "I feel terribly for his family, but he is not in Wu-Tang Clan."</p><p>"He is in his own group," Berry continues of Johnson, who performed with <strong>Northstar</strong>, who were briefly signed to Wu-Tang Productions. "<strong>RZA</strong> worked with them — as he does with countless other artists — years ago," the rep says. "[Northstar] was only loosely affiliated with Wu-Tang ten years ago… but [Johnson] was not a member of Wu-Tang Clan."</p><p>The injured rapper <a href=#>remains</a> in stable condition at Cedars-Sinai hospital in L.A. Doctors were unable to reattach his severed penis, TMZ reported Thursday.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I didn't know who he (or the group) was before this happened," Berry continues.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href=#>blog post</a>, that read "Parental Advisory: Don't Believe the HYPE. This Mother F–ker Ain't Got S–t to do with The WUTANG Brand," has since been deleted on the Wu-Tang Clan's website.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaappSnsm62zqGlrKeeYsCmwsSrnJ1loJq7qr%2BMsKxmrJGjtG6vy5qlZqqVpXqzscuemKydo2LAta3TnqSepqRif3F9k2pvbWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zoe-saldana-in-lucky-mag-i-m-obsessed-with-breasts-would-buy-a-pair.html><span>←</span><span>Zoe Saldana in Lucky Mag: I'm Obsessed With Breasts, Would Buy a Pair</span></a>
