As the mom of eight young kids, <strong><a href=#>Kate Gosselin</a></strong> is used to dealing with lots of different tasks (and people) all at once. So she wasn't fazed in the slightest by the prospect of going up against 15 other stars — including fellow reality TV standouts <strong><a href=#>Brandi Glanville</a></strong> and <strong>Kenya Moore</strong> — on season seven of The Celebrity Apprentice.</p><p>"I feel really in my element taking on something like this," the Kate Plus 8 star, 39, told <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> at a press event for the show in March, months before host <strong><a href=#>Donald Trump</a></strong>'s official announcement on Nov. 4. "Obviously it's hard to be away from my kids for an extended period, but they're good. They're very supportive."&nbsp;</p><p>Then, referencing her brief stint on season 10 of Dancing With the Stars, she joked, "I'm really excited to sort of take on a competition that I have a chance of doing well at, versus others I've done." (Gosselin and her partner, <strong>Tony Dovolani</strong>, were eliminated from DWTS after just five weeks.)&nbsp;</p><p>The mom of eight went on to explain that her experience as the matriarch of a big (and now very famous) family was comparable to running her own company. "I have a business-running personality," she said. "I work for myself. I'm the secretary, the personal assistant, the president, the accountant…and I run my ship at home as efficiently as possible."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Which is not to say there isn't room for improvement. "I'm willing and excited to learn whatever I can," Gosselin noted, adding that she "admires" Trump's work ethic and family values.</p><p>As for her competition? "I am a strong personality," the divorced star admitted. "But I think what definitely will come out here is that I'm not a pot stirrer, I'm definitely not a drama-starter. Drama gets in the way of getting work done…And, you know, that's probably going to be surprising to a lot of people. Clearly there's a lot of drama in my life caused by others, but I'm in the business —instead of stirring it — of calming it down and putting on the lid."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKarJVitLC%2F0p6joqZdpLtur8SlnJtlkaW9s7HNraCcnV2eum6tjKyrq6eenHqxsdGspqeZnJ7BunmRaWhtbGFmfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-segel-was-involved-in-a-love-triangle-behind-the-scenes-during-freaks-and-geeks.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Segel Was Involved In A Love Triangle Behind The Scenes During Freaks And Geeks</span></a>
