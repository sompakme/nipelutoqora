It featured Patricia Heaton, who was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fresh off her lucrative 'Everybody Loves Raymond' run</a>, plus Neil Flynn, and the three actors who played their kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charlie McDermott played the eldest Heck child, Axl, while Eden Sher and Atticus Shaffer played Sue and Brick, respectively.</p><p>When he joined the cast of 'The Middle,' McDermott was 19. But he would go on to spend more than 200 episodes portraying Axl Heck. He even directed an episode.</p><p>But the show ultimately wrapped in 2017, after nine seasons. It was an impressive run for the cast and the writers, but fans wondered what on earth McDermott would do afterward.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Happened To These 10 Forgotten Sitcom Stars</a></span></p><p>As it turns out, he hasn't strayed too far from his sitcom start. Per his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a> resume, McDermott went on to enjoy a film role in 'Instant Family' in 2018, right after 'The Middle' ended, although it&nbsp;was a minor part in comparison with Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne's roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And after that, Charlie had a short-term gig on a TV mini-series ('Unbelievable'). The following year, he was in a film called 'Countdown,' a horror-thriller that&nbsp;wasn't as well-received in its genre as 'The Middle' was in the sitcom realm.</p><p>Of course, film and TV aren't the only things the actor has been up to since his sitcom run ended. In 2017, Charlie married his wife, Sara Rejaie, though there are few photos of the pair on the actor's Instagram.</p><p>Fans can't really blame the actor and artist for being somewhat private on Instagram. Anytime he posts a photo (of anything, not just his face), the keenest fans jump all over his posts, telling him how much they miss 'The Middle' and calling him Axl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like countless other sitcom stars, it seems that Charlie's career might continue to be defined by his past gigs. Though he does have other interests, and it's evident that he doesn't intend to throw himself into mainstream TV or movie roles.</p><p>What fans&nbsp;will find on Instagram is Charlie's hobby off-screen; he clearly enjoys art and photography. But his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official website</a> also features short films and music (fans can find him on Spotify, Apple Music, and more).</p><p>Regardless of what direction he goes next, Charlie's talent is what has kept him on fans' radars. 'The Middle' may not have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the highest-earning sitcoms</a> out there, but it was popular enough that rabid fans continue to stalk McDermott.</p><p>And they'll continue to do so to see just what he does next -- whether it's acting, producing, photography, music, or something else entirely.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This 'Modern Family' Actor Has The Longest Sitcom Resume Ever</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1doralsMueZLCgkal6qa3PqZynnZRiwbB5wqGYq6SZmnqur8OeqaanpKl8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./there-is-a-new-dance-trend-on-tiktok-find-the-get-sturdy-meaning-tutorial-here.html><span>←</span><span>There Is A New Dance Trend On Tiktok: Find The Get Sturdy Meaning &amp;amp; Tutorial Here</span></a>
