She picked up a traditional saltbox-style residence in the quaint village of Ballard, just north of Santa Barbara in the Santa Ynez Valley. She then embarked on an extensive renovation and expansion of the premises in keeping with her French country roots. Now that beguiling French-inspired farmhouse — known as “Pepper Hill Farm” — has popped up for sale, as first reported by Siteline Santa Barbara.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>All Of Chris Martin's Girlfriends Ranked By Net Worth</b></a></span></p><p>Originally listed for $5.8 million over the summer, the place is now going for a discounted $4.85 million. And though that’s still a whopping $5 million and change over what Aumont and former husband Patrick doled out for the place more than 28 years ago, the couple did add a primary suite, summer veranda and porches, a detached one-bedroom cottage with its own kitchenette and bath, solar panels and a pool. They also had the grounds professionally landscaped, and converted an attic space into a guest bedroom with a full bath.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tucked away on a hillside parcel of land spanning 5 acres, the main clapboard structure was built in 2008. Featured are four bedrooms and five baths spread across a little more than 3,600 square feet of two-level living space, all of it accented throughout with the original limestone and distressed pine floors, crown moldings, high-ceilings, double-hung windows, Sartre limestone fireplaces and Moroccan tile.</p><p>According to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i>, </a>Highlights include a foyer sporting double Provencal doors that lead into a great room holding a living/dining area spotlighted by an 18th-century French corner cabinet and built-in 19th-century bar topped with Italian marble. An ensuite bedroom has been converted into a library boasting custom upholstered walls and new seagrass carpet, while the kitchen comes complete with painted cabinetry, newer stainless appliances and a light-filled breakfast nook.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vintage Venetian palazzo doors open into the spacious master retreat, which holds a fireplace, seating area, French doors spilling out to two balconies and a walk-in closet, plus a spa-like bath equipped with a relaxing Jacuzzi. Elsewhere in the house is a cozy fireside living room, music room and large screened veranda; and outdoors, the grassy property is laced with olive and oak trees, and hosts numerous spots ideal for al fresco lounging and entertaining amid rose gardens and an orchard. There’s also a restored four-stall barn with a tack room and riding arena.</p><p>The listing is held by Patty Murphy of Sotheby’s International Realty.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT</b><a href=#><b>: </b></a><a href=#><b>Bob Dylan’s ‘Desolation Row’ Handwritten Lyrics Are Being Sold for $425,000</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmahnZyau6Z5wK6kqKakYrmqv9OsZJygkae6qrrGZqqapqSWerq6xLNkn5miorWwwdKeZKedkad6tLvLr5inn12bvLN5k2ZvbmWdnrmttc6nZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./faze-jarvis-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-girlfriend-family-more.html><span>←</span><span>FaZe Jarvis Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
