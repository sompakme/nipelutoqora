Davidson, who detailed the nature of his relationship with Foxx in his memoir, Living in Color: What’s Funny about Me, recently spoke with PageSix about his current dealings with Foxx, whom Davidson says has not reached out to him since the book’s release.</p><p>“I haven’t actually heard from him,” Davidson admitted. “I threw some light on this because the book actually was about how my odyssey can help the reader. So I just pointed out all the situations I was in that I was able to eventually transcend. It was really a road map for the reader … not only understand something but over-stand it.”</p><p>According to Davidson’s memoir, Foxx’s cruel jokes towards him were part of his attempt to impress others on set at Davidon’s expense, and that things almost came to a head between the two due to Foxx’s rough play during a basketball game, nearly causing Davidson to sustain a brutal injury. “If I had hit my head on the hardtop concrete, that would have been the end of me,” Davidson wrote. “I was ready to give Jamie some street-fighting lessons too, but the crew pulled us off each other and held me back.”</p><p>In addition to their time working together on In Living Color, Davidson and Foxx starred opposite each other in the classic 1997 comedy Booty Call alongside <a href=# id=auto-tag_vivica-fox data-tag=vivica-fox>Vivica Fox</a> and <a href=# id=auto-tag_tamala-jones data-tag=tamala-jones>Tamala Jones</a>.</p><p>Living in Color: What’s Funny about Me is available for purchase <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m8rrnYZpuarpmZwLC6jKOYpqGVYrOwxNdmpJ6qk565pr%2FSpbBmpZWWu259kWxrb2xpaIN6ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mat-ishbia-wikipedia-wife-facts-to-know-about-united-wholesale-ceo.html><span>←</span><span>Mat Ishbia Wikipedia Wife: Facts To Know About United Wholesale CEO</span></a>
