That level of success has also allowed Stefani to accumulate <a href=#>a truly impressive fortune she is still adding to</a>.</p><p>Sadly for Stefani, however, she admitted that being a member of No Doubt took her away from her family. With that news in mind, some fans have been wondering what role that could have played in Stefani and Gavin Rossdale's dramatic divorce.</p><p>This article will reveal what Gwen Stefani revealed about how <strong>being a member of No Doubt took her away from her family</strong>.

During one very revealing section of the interview, Stefani spoke about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how hard it was for her to strike a balance</a> between her work and personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most specifically, Stefani talked to the outlet about regrets she has from the time she was working on No Doubt's final album to date, 2012's "Push and Shove". As Stefani explained, she now believes <strong>she should have spent more time with her family</strong> at that time instead of working on the album.</p><p>"God, what was I doing trying to please everybody?’ Because really, I should have just been with my family."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/band-members-of-no-doubt-including-gwen-stefani.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stefani also went on to talk to Nylon's interviewer about how she felt like she wasn't satisfying anyone or herself at that time. Trying to split her time between being a musician and a mother sadly made her feel like she was failing at both things.</p><p>“I would be leaving my family. And if I didn’t come home with a song, I’d be like, ‘Oh my God, I’m such a loser — I didn’t have dinner with my family, and I didn’t write a song. I wasted an entire day of my life trying to be in No Doubt again.’”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tiger-woods-and-ex-wife-elin-nordegren-were-slammed-with-plastic-surgery-rumors-after-their-divorce-front-deposit-back-instar.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Tiger Woods And Ex-Wife Elin Nordegren Were Slammed With Plastic Surgery Rumors After Their Divorce">Tiger Woods And Ex-Wife Elin Nordegren Were Slammed With Plastic Surgery Rumors After Their Divorce</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren's scandalous divorce wasn't messy enough for some people who thought the couple both underwent plastic surgery.</p><p>Of course, Stefani's comments about feeling like she was failing at everything are going to be relatable to far too many people. The tragic truth is that it is so common for women to feel the same way that Stefani described that there are seemingly endless articles on the subject.</p><p>How many songs has No Doubt charted, according to No Doubt?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Song:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Chart Peak:</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>"Running"</p></td><td><p>#62</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Simple Kind Of Life"</p></td><td><p>#38</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Settle Down"</p></td><td><p>#34</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Just A Girl"</p></td><td><p>#23</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Hella Good"</p></td><td><p>#13</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>'It's My Life"</p></td><td><p>#10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Hey Baby"</p></td><td><p>#5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Underneath It All"</p></td><td><p>#3</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Still, it is a good thing for someone like Stefani, who seems like she has everything together, to be honest about feeling the same way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-and-their-kids.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Stefani told Nylon that she is happy with the songs on No Doubt's 2012 album, she made it clear that it was a painful time in her life to remember.</p><p>"But we did it, and there are some good songs.

With that in mind, there is no way to definitively state that Stefani's work with No Doubt didn't contribute to her divorce in any way. After all, based on Stefani's 2024 comments, she clearly felt guilty about being away from her family and that could have affected things.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/gwen-stefani-almost-appeared-in-this-brad-pitt-movie-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Gwen Stefani Almost Completely Derailed Brad Pitt's Relationship With Angelina Jolie">Gwen Stefani Almost Completely Derailed Brad Pitt's Relationship With Angelina Jolie</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Brad Pitt's relationship with Jennifer Aniston might've lasted if Gwen Stefani got a certain role.</p><p>That said, based on what has been publicly reported on what led to Stefani and Gavin Rossdale's divorce, <strong>their split seems to have happened because of something he did</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An article from The Things revealed that in November 2015, US Weekly reported that <a href=#>Rossdale had a three-year affair with the family nanny</a>, Mindy Mann. Part of US Weekly's report also focused on how Stefani reportedly learned about the affair in an extremely dramatic fashion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/What-Happened-To-Gwen-Stefanis-Nanny-After-Her-Ex-Husbands-Affair-Rumors-(include-Gavin-Rossdale-and-nanny-as-well).jpg><p>According to US Weekly's reporting which cited the statements of an insider, the family's iPad was linked to Rossdale's phone. When one of Rossdale and Stefani's other nannies was using the iPad, they reportedly discovered unclothed photos of Mann and showed Stefani.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The family insider claims that Rossdale initially claimed that his relationship with Mann didn't go beyond flirtation. However, Rossdale would later admit to carrying on an affair with the nanny which left Stefani feeling "mortified, livid, and embarrassed" according to the insider.</p><p>Who are Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale's children, according to People?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Child:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Birthdate:</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Kingston James McGregor Rossdale</p></td><td><p>May 26, 2006</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Zuma Nesta Rock Rossdale</p></td><td><p>August 21, 2008</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apollo Bowie Flynn Rossdale</p></td><td><p>February 28, 2014</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Months later, in July 2016, Stefani spoke to Harper's Bazaar about what was going on in her career and personal life at the time. While talking to the outlet, Stefani spoke about how her son Apollo was eleven months old when "everything happened".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/kim-kardashian-finally-revealed-the-reason-she-and-kris-humphries-divorced-at-72-days-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Kim Kardashian Finally Revealed The Reason She And Kris Humphries' Divorced After 72 Days">Kim Kardashian Finally Revealed The Reason She And Kris Humphries' Divorced After 72 Days</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>After loads of rumors, Kim Kardashian revealed the sad reason she divorced Kris Humphries after only 72 days.</p><p>Harper's Bazaar's article that stemmed from their 2016 interview with Stefani then states that the "everything" the singer was talking about was discovering Rossdale's affair.</p><p>The article then quotes Stefani stating, "Everybody knows what happened next" and naming the date her life changed forever as "February 9". It is also worth noting that Stefani commented on how vividly she remembers the day her life changed. "I obviously know the date."</p><p>Stefani also explained to Harper's Bazaar that she spent months trying to get to the bottom of a secret after that date. "It was the beginning of hell. Like six, seven, eight months of torture, trying to figure out this big secret."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gwen-stefani-gavin-rossdale.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Stefani doesn't explicitly state that she was trying to learn everything about Rossdale's affair, that is the obvious implication. Stefani also went on to talk to Harper's Bazaar about how her family was ripped apart after that. "It was so insane because not only did my family break up, but then my kids are taken away like half the time, so that was really like, 'What?! What did I do?'"</p><p>While talking to Fabulous magazine in 2017, Gavin Rossdale stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he never wanted to get divorced from Stefani</a> at all. “[Divorce] was completely opposite to what I wanted. Really not…but here we are.”</p><p>Since Rossdale didn't want the divorce and Stefani pretty much blamed his affair, it seems pretty definitive that his infidelity caused the drama. That also makes it seem all but certain that Stefani's work with No Doubt wasn't a notable cause for the divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiesJ2eYsC1scWapaJlnqR6pbvUm6usZZSew7C%2Bwp5koJmmnrtuvs6sqp2ZnJp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-hailey-bieber-ditch-wearing-acrylic-nails-because-of-her-mom.html><span>←</span><span>Did Hailey Bieber Ditch Wearing Acrylic Nails Because Of Her Mom?</span></a>
