When Michaels first came to help out at the WWE Performance Center, he was testing the waters. Now, he says he fell in love with the atmosphere and hasn’t looked back.</p><p>“Well, it really is humbling. And that’s how I fell in love with this job. And, look, I initially came here five years ago and agreed to work six hours a week. That was the extent of it, but I did the environment, the culture here, I fell in love with it, and look, I’ll say this, this business has been so good to me. And so this is my way of being able to give back and look. Hunter is obviously my best friend in the whole wide world. So you couple that with the company that’s been good to me, and there are all the right reasons for me to be a part of this and to want to pass it on to the next generation.</p><p>“We have such wonderful young men and women that come through here. Another guy from NC State, Hank Walker, you know what I mean? He’s a guy that’s very young on our roster, and so, The Creed brothers went to Duke, there’s just so many different reasons to love what I do, and then those are just a couple of them, and look to be able to, I don’t know, allow my past, whether it be good, bad or otherwise if I can pass it on and help people to either not make mistakes or again, make the most of their opportunities. I want to do that because, again, I’ve been very fortunate to find out how wonderful this line of work can be. And to be able to help other young men and women achieve their dreams again, it’s just it’s a special thing to be able to do, and something to be a part of.”</p><p>Shawn Michaels then spoke about why it’s important for him to give back to the wrestling industry, feeling like it’s the least he can do for a business that gave him so much.</p><p>“That’s a simple one because I’ve lived long enough on this earth to see how much of a blessed life I’ve had. Honestly, again, that’s why I always get emotional when somebody asks me that kind of question. Because again, this job has been so good to me; this business, I don’t know. Like I said in my documentaries, the same business that almost killed me also saved me. And so, again, I don’t know; it’s the romance. We have such a blessed life, my family and I, and it’s because of this line of work, and I thoroughly loved to do it when I was out there. And again, and I want this next generation to love it as much as I did, and to want to go out there and perform for the people as much as I loved doing it. And so being able to pass that on to people. I think the business will be better for people if they’ll do it with the same heart that I did because I know that heart that I had for that performance inside the ring. So I guess that’s the reason why, again, because I think it’s the least I can do.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJsbHJvaGLAqa3Wp2SmoZOdrqa40madnqScYravecuorZ5lp57BqXnNsas%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reese-witherspoon-turns-to-dating-apps-to-find-love-again-after-jim-toth-divorce.html><span>←</span><span>Reese Witherspoon Turns To Dating Apps To Find Love Again After Jim Toth Divorce</span></a>
