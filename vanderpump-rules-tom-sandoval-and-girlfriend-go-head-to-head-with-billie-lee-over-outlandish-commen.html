Billie Lee was briefly on Vanderpump Rules as a SUR employee and friend of the cast. She and Sandoval became fast friends and was one of his only allies when he and Ariana Madix broke up. Now that Sandoval is dating Victoria,<strong> the drama between the trio has reached social media</strong> and media outlets.</p><p>Although Sandoval has few supporters after <a href=#>his affair with Rachel Leviss</a>, the drama between him, his new girlfriend, and his former friend is too juicy to not get involved. Follow along to see what shocking claims Billie Lee made about Victoria and Sandoval, and how the couple responded.</p><h2 id=billie-lee-made-some-shocking-claims-against-tom-sandoval-and-his-new-girlfriend-victoria-lee-robinson>Billie Lee Made Some Shocking Claims Against Tom Sandoval And His New Girlfriend Victoria Lee Robinson</h2><p>On an episode of Billie Lee’s podcast Billie & the Kid, <strong>Lee started spilling alleged private information</strong> about Tom Sandoval’s change in behavior around Victoria Lee Robinson, and how toxic their relationship was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tom-sandoval-laughing-on-the-vpr-red-carpet.jpg><p>One of Lee’s first explosive claims was that Sandoval stopped his sobriety once he and Victoria started dating. Once Sandoval started drinking, his behavior became erratic and darker.</p><p>“I noticed a lot of alarming things, especially how the house was a mess all the time. There was drugs laying around everywhere, and it was just a very dark time, and he was like just always depressed, they were fighting all the time, and I would get dragged into the fights.”</p><p>On top of this alleged behavior, <strong>Lee shared that Victoria was jealous of her friendship with Sandoval</strong> and assumed something more intimate was happening between them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/th-image-template-15.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Does Ariana Madix Have A Relationship With Tom Sandoval’s Family After Their Explosive Vanderpump Rules Cheating Scandal?">Does Ariana Madix Have A Relationship With Tom Sandoval’s Family After Their Explosive Vanderpump Rules Cheating Scandal?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Tom Sandoval's family had an idea about his infidelity before Ariana Madix even found out about it.</p><p>One event that Lee recalled was when she had Sandoval over at her house for a movie night. “[Victoria] kept on calling and calling and calling, and so [Sandoval] had to go upstairs, they got into a fight, he came downstairs, and he said, ‘She thinks that we’re gonna sleep together tonight.’ And I’m like, ‘What? This girl is acting like she’s my best friend.’”</p><p>Lee admitted that because of Sandoval’s celebrity, anyone who dated him after Vanderpump Rules' Ariana Madix was “thirsty.” <strong><a href=#>Sandoval and Madix had a dramatic relationship</a></strong>, but an even worse breakup after the afair. <strong>She implied that Victoria’s feelings weren’t genuine </strong>after she called Lee to complain about her relationship with Sandoval.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“[Victoria] would call me slurring words because she would be on something and she would say, ‘I need to break up with Tom.’ And I’m like, ‘Why would you call his best friend and say you have to break up with him?’ And then she would [say] she’s embarrassed to be with him. She can’t bring him to parties and she’s used to being with A-list celebrities,” Billie shared.</p><p>“It’d be 2 o’clock in the afternoon. This girl would be calling me, slurring her words, talking about how much she hates Tom Sandoval, but then you guys are together?

Sandoval and Madix shared the home during their relationship and continued sharing the space during their breakup. With Madix’s things still in the main bedroom, Lee alleged that Victoria had a problem with it.</li></ul><p>“[Victoria] just really wanted to let people know that she was in this relationship and that she was in this house.

Response with the TRUTH coming soon," Victoria wrote. But it didn't stop there, Victoria concluded her thoughts by defending Ariana Madix. “But first let me make something VERY clear. I have never and would never touch belongings that aren’t mine nor have I suggested to do so. I have nothing but respect for Ariana and it’s not my place to get involved.

On the YouTube channel Up and Adam,<strong>Victoria blamed her slurred speech on anxiety.</strong> “Whenever I get very nervous or anxious or anything I do slip on my words. I don’t do drugs. It has nothing to do with anything like that,” she said. “So that’s actually, like, very triggering and upsetting to me to hear.” Victoria went on to say that she cares for her ill father, who lives with her, all day because of swelling in his brain.</p><p>Victoria then dropped a bombshell claim about Billie Lee and Sandoval.</p><p>“[Billie Lee] asked Tom to be her sperm donor and she also wanted Tom’s last name.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Victoria shared that <strong>Sandoval was "flattered" that someone wanted his "genetics,"</strong> especially when he and Madix weren't going to have children. Although Sandoval wants kids, Victoria noted that he didn't want them with Billie. Sandoval allegedly told Billie he would "think about it" before declining the offer. However, after attending a party at Queer Eye's Karamo Brown's house, Victoria alleged that Brown congratulated Sandoval on possibly having a baby with Billie. Knowing what misinformation Billie was sharing, Sandoval "distanced himself."</p><p>With a rift between Sandoval and Lee, it's hard to say if they'll be friends again anytime soon — especially after the damning drug and alcohol allegations.
