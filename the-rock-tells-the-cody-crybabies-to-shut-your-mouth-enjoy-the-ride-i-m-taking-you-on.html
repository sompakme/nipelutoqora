With <a href=#>Cody</a> here [not in the match with Roman]. We expected it because it’s right there. Again, you go back and you’d like to think that I’ve got my finger on the pulse. We all try to keep our finger on the pulse, ultimately what the fans want and what they’re saying. And sometimes — often times, as you guys know, in sports and entertainment, anywhere, regardless of what vertical of business you’re in — there’s a wave of noise that happens right out of the gate that you just want to pause for a second, let’s not make any rash decisions and let’s wait and see what happens from there. So it was a matter of waiting — I was not surprised about it, I did expect it.”</p><h2 id=h-cody-crybabies>Cody Crybabies</h2><p>Johnson noted how his father and Dusty Rhodes were friends, as is he and Cody. He professed love for Cody and his fans, but noted the distinction between fans and the ‘Cody crybabies.’</p><p>“I love Cody, I love his passionate fans. Then there’s the other passionate fans of Cody, and they’re called the ‘Cody Crybabies’. Yeah, that’s what they’re called. The Cody Crybabies. These are grown ass men [mimics them complaining while typing on a computer keyboard] ‘Why isn’t Cody finishing his story?!? He has to finish his story!’ It’s like, wait a second… ‘Hey dad, you want to go outside and play catch with me?’ ‘Not now! Cody isn’t finishing his story and I’m upset!’ My wife comes in, ‘Hey honey, do you want to go have sex?’ ‘Not now! Cody’s gotta finish his story!’</p><p>“At the end of the day, look — You’ve got the Cody Crybabies, you’ve got the Cody fans and then you have Cody himself. And there’s a clear distinction between the three. But The Rock says this — those Cody Crybabies, the ones for every ten tweets, they’re shoving a chicken McNugget in their mouth, for every 20 tweets, they’re shoving two McNuggets up their ass, The Rock says this — you’ve got to sit back, know your role, shut your mouth and enjoy the ride that The Rock is going to take your candy asses on. So hashtag that, hashtag ‘shut your bitchasses up’. Hashtag Cody Crybabies.’ That’s the fun part of what we do. That’s pro wrestling, that’s WWE, and I can’t wait for this afternoon.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtamtrZWLBqbGMq6aco12psq240maroZ1dmLylxYycqbKakZe2pr%2BMraZmq5iqwW7Fzq6pZqWfqsGpecSnoaixXam1pnnRopueZZmierWtyqKloGWppMJuu80%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rob-lowe-supports-taylor-swift-travis-kelce-romance.html><span>←</span><span>Rob Lowe Supports Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce Romance</span></a>
