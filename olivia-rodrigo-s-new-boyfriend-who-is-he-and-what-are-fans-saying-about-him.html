He even reflected on how he and Dolan started their company right when COVID-19 began, stating how they wondered about doing something about their current situation where their writers and actors are all at home, in quarantine. This gave birth to their narrative podcast entitled Day by Day, a bi-weekly show that aired April 17, 2020.</p><h2 id=adam-faze-olivia-rodrigo-and-their-social-media-privacy><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Adam Faze, Olivia Rodrigo And Their Social Media Privacy</span></h2><p>Although Faze and Rodrigo’s sighting at Six Flags in June went viral, their relationship remains offline as of today. Faze has two Instagram accounts, and his personal account is private. However, his professional account @itsnotafaze is open to the public and is being followed by Rodrigo herself.</p><p>On the other hand, Olivia Rodrigo, on her account, has not yet posted anything regarding her relationship with Adam Faze.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-mind-the-gap><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Fans Mind The Gap</span></h2><p>What are fans saying about Olivia Rodrigo’s new love interest, Adam Faze? Well, for starters, they are not really in total support of the relationship, as the age gap between the couple is six years. As Olivia just turned 18 last February 2021, Faze is believed to be 24-years-old.</p><p>This was also the reason why fans went crazy on social media, especially on Twitter. When news broke about the movie event in California, where they were seen holding hands and being together the entire night. Olivia Rodrigo’s diehard followers expressed their thoughts on the social media platform, stating their dislike of the new couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it was not because Adam Faze is not worthy or might prove to be bad for Olivia, but mainly because of the age disparity between the two.</p><h2 id=was-he-dating-someone-just-before-olivia><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Was He Dating Someone Just Before Olivia?</span></h2><p>According to one Twitter user, Adam Faze might have actually been involved in another relationship just before getting together with the "Good 4 U" singer. And it would appear that he didn't end things amicably with the other girl, because she claims he totally ghosted her for Olivia, and it looks like she has the receipts to prove it.</p><p>However, fans of Olivia are coming to her defense stating she would not jump into another complicated relationship after just getting out of one.</p><p><span class=next-single><strong>NEXT:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney Love Calls Out Olivia Rodrigo For Copying Hole’s Album Concept</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimpaGmnq5uvs6dqaKfn6h6r7HWZpmosZantqa6w2aYnZmdYrOixsRmm56skZ65tHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mel-pearson-s-wife-and-salary-revealed-as-michigan-hockey-coach-got-fired.html><span>←</span><span>Mel Pearsons Wife And Salary Revealed As Michigan Hockey Coach Got Fired</span></a>
