Welcome to a realm where historical artifacts, <a href=#>rare collectibles</a>, and astonishing memorabilia find their way into the hands of those with deep pockets and a taste for the extraordinary. Let’s embark on a journey through the top dollar deals, unveiling the 8 most expensive <a href=#>Pawn Stars</a> items.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jfk-s-cigar-box---60-000>JFK’s Cigar Box - $60,000</h2><p>The cigar box that belonged to President John F. Kennedy during his administration and still contained a few cigars was recently acquired by Pawn Stars, making it one of their most significant items ever. This piece of presidential history was once on JFK's desk in the Oval Office, and the opportunity to obtain it was a once-in-a-lifetime chance. The box was sold for $60,000 to the person who brought it to the store, given its value and the prestige associated with it being owned by one of the most revered former presidents of the United States.</p><h2 id=2014-hertz-penske-gt-mustang---60-000>2014 Hertz Penske GT Mustang - $60,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite being older, cars are typically among the priciest items featured on the show. However, Rick didn't hesitate to spend a substantial amount of money on a 2014 Hertz Penske GT Mustang, which was developed in partnership with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hertz and Roger Penske</a>. The car's rarity made it worth the $60,000 price tag, as it was one of only ten produced. In 2013, Hertz partnered with businessman and NASCAR team owner Roger Penske to create a limited edition version of the iconic GT Mustang. The result was the 2014 Hertz Penske GT Mustang, with only 150 units ever made.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 8 Best-Selling 'RPGs' Of All Time, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=1915-panama-pacific-octagonal-gold-coin---67-500>1915 Panama Pacific Octagonal Gold Coin - $67,500</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The United States Mint created the 1915 Panama Pacific Octagonal $50 Gold Coin as a commemorative item for the opening of the Panama Canal, which was showcased at the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition. Rick ensured that he obtained the coin when a client offered to pay $70,000 for it. This unique coin is one of its kind, with only one other coin of a round shape. During one of the <a href=#>world's biggest auctions</a> of coins in Atlanta, Rick located and purchased it for $67,500.</p><h2 id=1932-custom-ford-roadster---68-250>1932 Custom Ford Roadster - $68,250</h2><p>The prevalence of valuable items on Pawn Stars, such as vintage automobiles and antiques, indicates that significant sums of money are at play. In one instance, a customer requested a meeting with Rick and Corey Harrison to discuss a striking 1932 Custom Ford Roadster finished in matte black. Despite the owner having spent roughly $140,000 on the vehicle over three years, he was compelled to sell it due to personal circumstances. Rick and Corey engaged in challenging negotiations to acquire the customized Roadster, eventually settling on a price of $68,250.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1922-proof-peace-high-relief-dollar---80-000>1922 Proof Peace High Relief Dollar - $80,000</h2><p>One of the <a href=#>rarest coins</a> in America, the 1922 High Relief Dollar, was purportedly won in a poker game by an individual who was now looking to sell it for $20,000. He claimed that there were only 12 of these coins in existence and that he knew what it was. Rick became involved in the deal, and after the coin was appraised by experts who valued it at between $50,000 and $100,000, he was able to negotiate a higher price. Despite the seller's initial asking price of $20,000, Rick eventually purchased the rare coin for $80,000, thereby securing a substantial profit.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>JD Fever: The 10 Most Expensive Bottles Of Jack Daniels Ever, Ranked</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1941-gibson-sj-200-guitar---85-000>1941 Gibson SJ-200 Guitar - $85,000</h2><p>Thanks to Stephen Stills of Crosby, Still, and Nash, a new guitar was added to the collection of notable instruments. The seller of the <a href=#>expensive guitar</a> presented a certified bill of sale as proof that the renowned folk-rock musician had previously owned the guitar. The guitar in question was a remarkable 1941 Gibson SJ-200 that had been played by Stills during his time with Crosby, Stills & Nash. The Gold & Silver Pawn Shop acquired the guitar from its current owner for a significant sum of $85,000 after verifying the evidence of Stills' ownership and use of the instrument.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1961-gibson-sg-les-paul-guitar---90-000>1961 Gibson SG Les Paul Guitar - $90,000</h2><p>Les Paul is a renowned figure in the realms of electric guitars and rock music, having been one of the original creators and manufacturers of electric guitars. Alongside his wife, Mary Ford, Les Paul gained notoriety in the 1950s by selling millions of albums and employing the guitars that he himself had designed. A buyer approached Harrison's shop with a custom-built <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1961 Gibson Les Paul Guitar</a>, which Les Paul had gifted to his wife Mary. The seller was initially asking for an exorbitant $250,000 for the instrument. However, the Harrisons were able to negotiate an exceptional deal, eventually acquiring the guitar for $90,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1932-lincoln-roadster---95-000>1932 Lincoln Roadster - $95,000</h2><p>During the Great Depression, the Harrison family spent considerable money on a luxurious Lincoln Roadster, which was kept in impeccable condition. The Roadster was a mint and cream color, boasting a large V-12 engine concealed under its massive hood. The family was so impressed with the car that they couldn't resist buying it, despite the high cost. In 1932, Ford, the parent company of Lincoln, introduced the Roadster as a way to lure customers away from rival brand Cadillac. Rick and the Old Man offered a cash payment to secure the purchase of the 1932 <a href=#>antique automobile</a> with 150 horsepower, which was worth close to $100,000.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>From Gold To Diamonds: The Most Expensive Toothbrushes In The World, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rarest</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">History</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Finance101</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMpqasrF2axbGxzaygr51dnsGmudJmpqdlpKt6tLTOsGSpmaejerTAwKuqZqqRo7imsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rob-lowe-how-tall-net-worth-how-much-is-lowe-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Rob Lowe How Tall Net Worth How Much is Lowe Worth?</span></a>
