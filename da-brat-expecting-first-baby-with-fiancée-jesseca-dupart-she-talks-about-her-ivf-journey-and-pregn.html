The married couple’s attempts to have a child have run into some significant obstacles.</span></p><p><span>Recently, Da Brat and Jesseca Dupart visited The Tamron Hall Show to discuss in vitro fertilization. As Dupart talked about the challenges of attempting to conceive a child, she almost broke down in tears. So, are Da Brat and Judy expecting their first child?</span></p><h2><span>Who Is Pregnant Da Brat Or Judy?</span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/da-brat-jesseca-dupart-mc-2x1-220201-e9ed45.jpg alt="is da brat pregnant" width=2400 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span>The announcement of Da Brat’s pregnancy caused considerable confusion among the rapper’s followers who wondered which of the two women was carrying the child. <strong><b>They revealed <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Jesseca “Judy” Dupart</a> is expecting their first child with Da Brat.</b></strong></span></p><p><strong>See Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Does Shawn Killinger Have a Child? Everything About Her Husband and Adopted Daughter Jagger Jude</a></p><p><span>Jesseca and Da Brat each shared a set of three images on their Instagram accounts in January to share the good news. The rapper is pictured encircling her future wife and cradling her growing belly. Since the announcement, Jesseca’s baby bump has also been seen in some of her other Instagram images.</span></p><h2><span>When Are Da Brat And Judy Expecting Their First Baby?</span></h2><p><span>Baby Harris-Dupart hasn’t yet been given a confirmed due date. The kid could be born at the beginning of 2023, while Jessica wasn’t yet showing when they first announced the news. It seems logical for the couple to keep this information under wraps given that Da Brat values her privacy. In actuality, she hasn’t been this exposed until this reality show.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EP_BRAT_BREAKER_COMP.jpg alt="is da brat pregnant" width=1500 height=1000 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span>Da Brat first came out as gay in 2020, the same year that she made her first public declaration of her relationship with Jesseca. She has, however, worked in the music industry for many years, and there have long been reports that she found ladies attractive at the time.</span></p><h2><span>Doctor Advised Da Brat Against Her Pregnancy</span></h2><p><span>Due to IVF problems, Judy and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Da Brat</a> were both admitted to hospitals. The Chicago rapper was adamant that he would keep trying despite age-related dangers and blood clots that could have been fatal. The 48-year-old talked about the newly discovered problem of fibroid tumors on an episode of Brat Loves Judy.</span></p><p><span>Although there are many ways to become a mother, this information signaled the conclusion of a very specific strategy. Da Brat had a dream about a growing baby born from a donor sperm and Judy’s egg.</span></p><p><strong>See Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>“Let’s Make A Deal” Tiffany Coyne’s Pregnancy: All You Need to Know</a></p><p>The rapper revealed the news in line with her tomboyish attitude as the pair simultaneously shared it with PEOPLE and on their personal social media sites. They captioned a combined photo with “BLESSINGS all 2023” and expressed gratitude to the Georgia reproductive clinic HopeFertility for its assistance in getting them to this stage.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Da-Brat-and-wife-Jesseca-DuPart-announce-pregnant-with-first-child-4.-Instagram_Da-Brat_Getty.jpg alt="is da brat pregnant" width=1996 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 1996px) 100vw, 1996px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The 48-year-old told PEOPLE that she believed that as she approaches 50, having a kid wouldn’t be a good fit for her.</p><p>She Said:</p><p>“I never thought I was going to have kids. I just thought it wasn’t in the cards for me. I’ve had a great career, a full life. I felt like, because I didn’t get pregnant earlier on, then it just wasn’t going to happen for me.”</p><p>And there were other challenges that added to that sensation, such as fibroids and polyps that needed to be surgically removed before egg retrieval could start.</p><p><strong>See Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Is Jennifer Lawrence Pregnant?

She has a daughter named Deja, two boys named Byron Jr. and Jay, and two siblings. Da Brat admitted that she was “dying to feel” what it was like to carry a child in a confessional.</span></p><p><span>Da Brat and Judy still have something to be happy about despite the most recent setback.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaKiimrSvrc2tZqKrXZmubq7RmqtmqKKatK%2Btza1manBlZoJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./antonio-brown-jr-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Antonio Brown Jr Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
