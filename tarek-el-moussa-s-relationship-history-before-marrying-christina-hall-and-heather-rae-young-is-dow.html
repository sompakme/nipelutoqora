After his wife <a href=#>Heather Rae Young froze their embryos</a>, they conceived their baby boy without doing IVF, and Heather gave birth to Tristan Jay in January. The couple also debuted their HGTV series <a href=#>The Flipping El Moussas, which fans didn't enjoy</a>.</p><p>Tarek El Moussa's second wife has a lot in common with his first wife Christina Hall. They both have successful real estate careers, popular social media accounts, and have starred on multiple reality shows. But while Tarek's two marriages have been highly publicized, not much is known about what his love life looked like before he met Christina and Heather.</p><h2 id=who-did-tarek-el-moussa-date-before-he-married-christina-hall>Who Did Tarek El Moussa Date Before He Married Christina Hall?</h2><p><a href=#>Christina Hall has a higher net worth than Tarek El Moussa</a>, but the two are still examples of the kind of success that people can achieve in the real estate world. Tarek El Moussa and Christina Hall were married from 2009 to 2018 and since they co-starred on Flip Or Flop, they were a great team. Of course, things got messy when they split up, and Tarek married Heather Rae Young in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tarek hasn't been very open about what his dating life looked like prior to 2005. Did he have any serious relationships?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/christina-hall-tarek-el-moussa.jpg><p>According to People, Christina and Tarek became pals in 2005, and their relationship started in October 2006. People reported that Christina and Tarek maintained a platonic relationship when they first got to know each other because Tarek had a girlfriend at the time.</p><p>However, People didn't share any details about who that girlfriend was or what that relationship looked like. It doesn't seem like Tarek has ever spoken about it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Was Christina In The Country A Ratings Hit For HGTV Or Did Christina Hall’s Brand Get Tired Fast?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Things moved fast between Christina and Tarek. They actually began living together the same day that they decided to date. Since Tarek fell in love with Christina quickly, it's possible that the other relationship wasn't serious. It sounds like he was able to move on easily. Tarek and Christina didn't wait long before marrying in 2009 and having their children Taylor and Brayden.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/christina-hall-tarek-el-moussa-2.jpg><p>The couple was in their 20s when they started their relationship.

She became famous at the same time as him, and they are both used to talking to the press about their personal lives. He might want to keep his previous girlfriends' identities private.</p><h2 id=who-did-tarek-el-moussa-date-before-he-married-heather-rae-young>Who Did Tarek El Moussa Date Before He Married Heather Rae Young?</h2><p>After Tarek El Moussa and Christina Hall shared that they would be getting divorced, all eyes were on Tarek and his love life.</p><p>TMZ reported in December 2016 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tarek and Alyssa Logan were together</a>.

According to Country Living, Tarek said that he and Christina were "both trying to get back into the dating scene." Tarek explained to Country Living, "I'm just kind of doing my own thing. I'm enjoying being single. I have a lot of friends. I go out and have a good time and focus on my kids and my career." It seems that Tarek was dating casually and not thinking too much about the future at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Country Living reported that Tarek actually mentioned his love life on Flip Or Flop. He told Christina he was going to "meet somebody," and it sounded like he was going on a date. He never specified who that person was, though.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/heather-rae-young-tarek-el-moussa.jpg><p>It doesn't sound like Tarek El Moussa expected to find an epic love again after divorcing Christina Hall. But as fans know, that's exactly what happened. According to Us Weekly, he and Heather Rae Young met in July 2019 and started dating in August 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortly after that, Tarek shared the news on Instagram. According to People, he wrote, “It’s official!!!! After more than 3 years on my own I’m so PROUD to say that this beautiful, sweet and talented young lady is my girlfriend! I just want to let the world know I met someone special that makes me want to be a better man. So tell me!! Are we a cute couple or what?”</p><p>Heather and Tarek spoke to People about how much they loved each other. Tarek said, “We’ve been spending a lot of time together…and we just have so much fun. After all the hardships that I’ve experienced, and there’s so many ups and downs in life, sometimes having fun is like the best medicine.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/heather-rae-young-1.jpg><p>While Tarek and Heather's relationship has always seemed great, Heather has talked about how it isn't always easy to date someone who has an ex-spouse and children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Page Six, Heather was interviewed by The Today Show and said, "I was always second." She said, "no one ever made me feel that way. I think when your significant other had such a long relationship with the previous spouse, and a lot of love, and it was very public divorce, you’re coming into it, and you fall in love with each other, but you always kind of think of the ex."</p><p>After Tarek El Moussa went through a hard divorce, he definitely found lasting happiness with Heather Rae Young.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmqqVoHqmuIympq6ro5bAbr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2afoqukpL%2B6ecGenaiqlWK6or7RsqCnn12YtbO10q2gp5ldna6tuIyhnJqsmJq%2Fbr7AnmSyp6WjtHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robin-williams-wife-susan-schneider-revealed-the-actor-s-death-was-more-than-just-depression.html><span>←</span><span>Robin Williams' Wife Susan Schneider Revealed The Actor's Death Was More Than Just Depression</span></a>
