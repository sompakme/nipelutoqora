He held Mauz as they posed for photos, looking adorable in his black suit and shiny dress shoes, while also embracing Paige, who dazzled in a long, flowing black dress.</p><p>During the event, Mauz shared a heartwarming moment with gala host Robert Irwin, the son of Steve Irwin, who crouched down to greet the young toddler.

Muniz's talent and charisma made him a household name, earning him critical acclaim and numerous awards, including a Golden Globe nomination and two Emmy Award nominations. Additionally, he received multiple Teen Choice Awards and Young Artist Awards for his performances.</p><p>However, in recent years, Muniz has taken a step back from the spotlight, citing a desire for a more private life away from the pressures of Hollywood.</p><p>Despite stepping away from acting, Muniz has remained active in various ventures. He has pursued a career in race car driving, even competing in professional racing circuits. Additionally, Muniz has ventured into music, playing drums for the band Kingsfoil.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In his personal life, Muniz has found happiness with his wife, Paige Price, whom he married in 2020. The couple welcomed their son in March 2021, but have been careful to shield him from the spotlight, clearly not wanting to push him to be a child actor like Frankie was.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reflecting on his decision to step away from the spotlight</a>, Muniz has spoken candidly about the toll of fame and the importance of finding balance in life. He has emphasized the value of privacy and living a fulfilling life outside of Hollywood's glare.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq5meoLamecyupaKyo2LAsLqMq5irnV2WvbGxwKuYp5uVYr%2BmsIycmKuolal6pbHBrqtmr5ikuaZ5xZqkoqSpZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities-whose-names-we-ve-been-saying-wrong.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrities Whose Names We've Been Saying Wrong</span></a>
