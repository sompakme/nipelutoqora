When you’re making a transformation, it takes a lot of discipline,” she told Page Six Style.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">When asked if she feels “hotter” now with her new image, she replied, “Hotter isn’t even the word! Refreshed and superior is what I would say. This is the best I’ve felt my whole life. My confidence is through the roof, and I’m loving the woman I’m becoming.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">White visited the Ethika HQ back in April where they showed her around the warehouse. She wore a two-piece set with her hair two-toned.
