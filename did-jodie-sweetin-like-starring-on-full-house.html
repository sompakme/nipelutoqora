Did she like starring on&nbsp;Full House? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=being-a-child-star>Being A Child Star</h2><p>Fans of&nbsp;Full House&nbsp;always want to hear about what life was like on the set of the popular '90s family sitcom.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jodie Sweetin shared that it was tough to say goodbye to the show</a>&nbsp;as she wasn't sure if she and the cast would stay in touch and that was really sad.</p><p>In her memoir&nbsp;unSweetined, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jodie Sweetin&nbsp;described her&nbsp;experience&nbsp;on the set</a>&nbsp;and said that it was tough. She explained what it was like being a child star: she wrote, “On set, I just wanted to be a kid. But Full House was a job and I was expected to behave like a miniature adult.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;Collider, Sweetin has also talked about the tough times that she had, as she began drinking alcohol when she was 14 years old and&nbsp;started abusing meth.</p><p>E! News&nbsp;reported that Sweetin used meth daily and she explained,&nbsp;"Everything revolved around my addiction.&nbsp;On a typical day, I'd wake up and feel terrible because I hadn't done any. You're either trying to get it, doing it or worrying about when you're going to get it next. You don't even realize that it's taken over so quickly."</p><p>It sounds like it was really tough for Sweetin when&nbsp;Full House&nbsp;went off the air after 8 seasons. According to&nbsp;Ranker.com, she was 13, and she shared that this led to her abusing alcohol. She said,&nbsp;"There is a certain sense of loss when a series ends. It is kind of hard to figure out who you are when you've lost your job at age 13, when that was basically how you identified yourself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ranker.com&nbsp;says that when Sweetin was 20 years old, she wasn't sure that she would return to Hollywood and act. She said,&nbsp;"I don't have any desire to ever act again full time.
