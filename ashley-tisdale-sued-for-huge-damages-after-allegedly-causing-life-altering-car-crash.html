However, Gonzales is facing approximately $140,000 in medical expenses for her significant neck and back injuries, so she’s likely hoping to be awarded six figures in compensation from the lawsuit.</p><p>Ashley has a reported net worth of $12 million. Though she’s slowed down her acting gigs in recent years, the mother-of-one has turned her attention to her skincare business, Frenshe. She previously started a lifestyle blog of the same name in 2020, born out of the pandemic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ashley’s skincare line <a href=#>dropped in stores (including Target) earlier this year</a>, and it prided itself in offering all products under $17. The company’ currently valuation isn’t publicly known, but many celebrities have been able to successfully launch skincare and fashion brands, largely due to their big social following and reputation.</p><p>However, if Ashley is found responsible for the serious car crash, she may not only have to pay up, but it could also affect her reputation in the long-term.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: &nbsp;<a href=#>Report Claims Caitlyn Jenner Plans To Leave Kendall & Kylie Out Of Her $25 Million Will</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSutLTLnrBmrJmosaK4xGaqrp2UYrOwvoyhrKCdXZmurq3GnqpmmZapsrN5wKWjnp%2BVmbm6ecKarKyhnpx6rbXFnmSapKSav6q6xmaamqpdmL%2Biv8do</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-shaina-hurley-after-love-is-blind.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Shaina Hurley After Love Is Blind?</span></a>
