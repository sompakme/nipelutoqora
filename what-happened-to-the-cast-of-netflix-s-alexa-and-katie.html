Although it looks like a standard plot, there's an element that makes the show totally unconventional: Alexa is diagnosed with cancer. The series teaches a lot of valuable lessons. But what do the show's actors think about the sitcom and their roles? And what are they doing in real life? Before getting to know more about the cast members, let's look deep into one of the scenes that impacted viewers the most: Did the actresses really sacrifice their hair for playing their part on the show?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Part of Alexa's struggle on the show was losing her hair. A huge loss for a teenage girl. Many fans of the series were wondering whether the Alexa & Katie actresses actually shaved their hair. However, they didn't. Paris Berelc and Isabel May were wearing bald caps and tons of makeup. It was an exciting experience for Paris to become fake bald for her role. Here are all the details about the cast of Alexa & Katie.</p><h2 id=paris-berelc-is-already-a-well-established-actress>Paris Berelc Is Already a Well-Established Actress</h2><p>Before landing the lead part in Alexa & Katie, the young actress had several roles. Fans may have seen her in Disney shows Mighty Med and Lab Rats: Elite Force. She's also been a model since she was nine years old. When it came to making Alexa & Katie, the series creators clearly knew what kind of actress they wanted for the leading role, and Paris Berelc was the first actress to be cast in the sitcom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Netflix's New Korean Dating Show, 'Single's Inferno,' Details Revealed</a></span></p><p>The star is enjoying her experience on the show, and although it deals with the tough topic of cancer, she doesn't think of it as a sad series. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Talk Nerdy With Us</a>, the actress said: "I mean, if you do cry, which you might, it's tears of joy and like, 'Oh my God, I wish I had a best friend like that.' It's not like, 'Oh my God, that's so sad.' It's not like that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cancer is a disease that can affect anyone, including celebrities <a href=#>like The Real Housewives Of Orange County star Vicki Gunvalson</a>. To properly prepare for the role, Berelc did her own research. She talked to a lot of people who had cancer in the past. Among others, she met with a girl diagnosed with cancer and learned how she wanted to do all the things an average teen would do despite being ill. Paris also investigated what they wanted to eat during chemotherapy, how they felt, and how they continued with their lives after learning about the diagnosis.</p><h2 id=39-alexa-amp-katie-39-was-isabel-may-39-s-debut-as-an-actress>'Alexa & Katie' Was Isabel May's Debut as an Actress</h2><p><a href=#>Child actors can become the highest-paid stars of Hollywood</a>. Nevertheless, Isabel didn't begin her acting career at a very young age. Most fans will be surprised to know that Katie was Isabel's first role. Her lack of acting experience surprised Isabel's co-star, Paris Berelc. "She’s great. She’s very mature for her age. She’s just really great. She’s a very sweet girl," Berelc said to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Young Entertainment</a> magazine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Isabel, she still has a lot to learn as an actress, and the show taught her many things. One of them was how to combine drama and comedy. Interestingly, in her interview with Young Entertainment magazine, the actress shared that it was easier during the dramatic scenes than during the comedic ones.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> What Is 'Snowflake Mountain'? Here's What You Need To Know About Netflix's New Reality Show</a></span></p><p>In an effort to be funnier, May began using her body language at some point. Eventually, the writers included her body language in the show, and Katie became even more charming. Isabel enjoys being on the show not only because it has made her famous but also because it teaches the audience some very important lessons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jolie-jenkins-finally-gained-recognition-for-playing-katie-39-s-mom-in-39-alexa-amp-katie-39>Jolie Jenkins Finally Gained Recognition For Playing Katie's Mom in 'Alexa & Katie'</h2><p>As a single mom to Katie, she does her best o keep her family in the nice neighborhood they live in, and she does it with a lot of humor. The actress Jolie Jenkins is phenomenal as Jennifer, and she once confessed that it's her favorite role ever, partly because it's the longest job she's had. Before that, the actress briefly appeared in supporting roles. Some of her projects include The West Wing, How I Met Your Mother, and House of Lies. Fans probably remember her as Deirdre from Desperate Housewives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress enjoys playing Jennifer in Alexa & Katie, and her cast mates have already become like family to her. The actress doesn't have to raise her kids alone in real life because she's happily married to artist and designer David Pagani. They have two sons together. Both Jolie and David often post their family photos on their respective Instagram accounts, and they couldn't look happier together.</p><h2 id=emery-kelly-has-an-extraordinary-talent-for-singing>Emery Kelly Has an Extraordinary Talent for Singing</h2><p>Emery Kelly plays Lucas in the series. His character is pretty unique, especially when he flaunts his hair even after his sister Alexa has gone through chemotherapy and shaved hers. Kelly quickly became pretty popular. <a href=#>Some actors learn to sing for a role</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Kelly's musical talent has always been outstanding. Seven years ago, the actor participated in The X Factor, and although he didn't reach the final round, he still impressed the judges with his talent. After the show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emery and other participants formed a boy band named </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forever in Your Mind</a>. The band was together for five years, but these days it looks like Kelly is focusing on his acting career rather than singing.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Are These Original Disney Channel Sidekicks Doing Now?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYpZ2olnqiusNmopqsmZp6pK3SrWSnnaSbuarEjLCfmqxdna6xvMSnnJ1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-chicks-laura-lynch-dies-at-65-after-head-on-car-collision.html><span>←</span><span>The Chicks' Laura Lynch Dies at 65 After Head-On Car Collision</span></a>
