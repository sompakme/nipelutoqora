In the production design, the stairs are twisted and in some places they’re broken or still moving. We would be trying to mirror that sort of idea in these two pieces of jewelry.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/beauty_and_the_beast_necklace_embed-95732a25-fd1d-4394-8819-a1e660f61d83.jpg><p>Durran added that the necklace is meant to look “like a tree of life that’s still in motion.”</p><p>Belle wears it around her neck as she and the Beast (Dan Stevens) share a waltz around the ballroom to the iconic tune of “Beauty and the Beast” — and it’s available to purchase.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A replica of the stunning bauble, which is plated in 18K gold and features .162 carats worth of teeny diamonds, is part of HSN’s Beauty and the Beast collection ($356, <i><a href=#>hsn.com</a></i>).
