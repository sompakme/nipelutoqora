After moving from White Rock to West Point Grey, she attended high school at Lord Lyng. During her early years, she worked as a model for the Girls Guide of Canada.

With each project, she has taken risks and ventured into comedy, drama, and action thrillers. Let’s look at how the <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> star Cobie Smulders built her $25 million fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=entering-the-show-business-and-how-i-met-your-mother>Entering The Show Business And <i>How I Met Your Mother</i></h2><p>Born as Jacoba Francisca Maria, the actress had an aunt with the same name, so she decided to stick with her nickname Cobie after entering show business. During her teen years, Smulders gained acting experience through her performances in theater at her high school. While modeling at a young age made her hesitant about show business, she dropped out of college to pursue her dream of being an actress. Smulders made her debut in a small role with <i>Jeremiah</i> in 2002. Before she ventured into comedy, she had recurring roles in <i>Veritas: The Quest</i> and <i>The L Word</i>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Meet Reed Hastings: The Billionaire Founder And Co-CEO Of Netflix</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carter Bays and Craig Thomas were writers on <a href=#><i>The Late Show With David Letterman</i></a>, and they wanted to execute the concept of a group of friends who lived in New York. They pitched the idea to CBS, which was picked up, and <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> went into pre-production. While the other actors cast on the show were known through small projects, Cobie Smulders was a new face for audiences everywhere. The role of Robin Scherbatsky was initially offered to Jennifer Love-Hewitt, who turned it down, and Smulders was cast, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>.</p><h2 id=battling-a-disease-and-powering-through>Battling A Disease And Powering Through</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cobie Smulders earned her breakthrough, and audiences worldwide saw her for the first time when <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> aired on CBS in September 2005. The 23-year-old became an instant hit, and her character's story revolved around the central love triangle on the show. After two seasons of the show, Smulders suffered from a bloated stomach and abdominal cramps, which caused her to get a doctor’s consultation. It was then that the actress was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. As Marie Claire mentioned, Cobie Smulders underwent surgeries to remove cancer from her body.</p><p>The illness is difficult to treat, and Smulders began an initiative with pharma company TESARO to launch the Not On My Watch campaign to create awareness and aid for ovarian cancer. The actress went into remission and later took to platforms to share her story. Smulders continued working on <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> for all nine seasons, and her character continued developing throughout the show. For the final season, Smulders made $340,000 per episode, which is $10 million for a season, making her one of the highest-paid actresses on television in 2014. The actress has pursued other exciting projects along with the hit television show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joining-the-marvel-cinematic-universe>Joining The Marvel Cinematic Universe</h2><p>During the filming of the <a href=#>seventh season of </a><a href=#><i>How I Met Your Mother</i></a>, reports began arriving that Marvel had been auditioning for the role of Agent Maria Hill of S.H.I.E.L.D, who would share a considerable screen time with Samuel L.
