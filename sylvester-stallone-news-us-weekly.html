Six years later, Frank Sr. and Jackie welcomed another son, <strong>Frank Stallone Jr.</strong>, who would go on to become a famous composer whose music was featured in several of his older brother’s movies. After the Stallones’ divorce, both Frank Sr. and Jackie had children with their respective partners, giving Sly and Frank Jr. multiple half-siblings.</p><p>While attending school in Pennsylvania, Sylvester found his passion for acting and football. After working as a sports coach at the American College of Switzerland, the Golden Globe winner went on to study drama at the University of Miami, though he left school to become an actor before earning his degree.</p><p>Sylvester got his big break when he scored a starring role in the 1974 film The Lords of Flatbush, on which he also had a writing credit. Just two years later, the Victory actor became a bonafide movie star with the enormous success of Rocky, which he wrote, starred in and turned into an ongoing film franchise. He was nominated for two Oscars for the movie (Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay) as well as two Golden Globes.</p><p>Sly continued to dominate the box office the following decade with the start of the Rambo films, three of which were released in the ‘80s. The action star, who was now known for his hulking frame and movie star status, rode the wave of his stardom throughout the ‘90s and 2000s, making a triumphant return to the Rocky series in the spinoff Creed films beginning in 2016. In 2017, he won a best supporting actor Golden Globe for his work as Rocky in the critically-acclaimed movie. That same year, Sylvester entered the Marvel Cinematic Universe by portraying Stakar Ogord in the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.</p><p>In addition to a wildly successful career spanning decades, Sylvester’s personal life has also made headlines throughout the years. The Expendables star has been married three times: first, to <strong>Sasha Czack</strong> — with whom he shares late son Sage and son Seargeoh — from 1974 to 1985, second, to model <strong>Brigette Nielsen</strong> from 1985 to 1987, and finally, to <strong>Jennifer Flavin</strong>, with whom he tied the knot in 1997. The two share daughters Sophia, Sistine, and Scarlet. In August 2022, Flavin filed for divorce from her husband of over two decades, Us Weekly confirmed.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxno665t7HSrZyrZaOprq24zqecaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./micah-morris.html><span>←</span><span>Micah Morris</span></a>
