Many eagle-eyed fans have become glued to their screen like hawks, awaiting the next drama-filled episode with much anticipation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like any other reality TV show, Married At First Sight is filled with fiery drama and intense relationships, and focuses on matching couples based on scientific and sociological factors. The couples will then see themselves spending an extended period of six weeks together as a married couple, before making a final decision on whether they want to be together.</p><p>During this time, the couples will be reviewed on a regular basis by a team of professionals with backgrounds in psychology, psychotherapy, anthropology, and theology.</p><p>However, due to the sudden onset of intensity, fights and drama usually begin to break out not long after, and from the start, it is usually abundantly clear that some couples are better matches than others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-taylor-and-brandon-still-together>Are Taylor And Brandon Still Together?</h2><p>At first, Brandon and Taylor seemed like the perfect couple for many as they stood by the altar. However, the tides would quickly take a turn for the worst when Taylor decided to film Brandon waking up on their honeymoon. This caused an angry outburst, which would set a strenuous tone for the rest of the relationship. Now the couple was on treacherous waters.</p><p>A domino effect then rained down on the couple, one argument led to another, leading to a downward spiral that would mark the end of their relationship. One of the main causes of the couple's woes was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandon's issue with Taylor's social media use</a>.</p><p>Throughout their relationship, he made it abundantly clear that he was not happy about it. However, Taylor bit back, and arguments continually flared up between the pair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fights would also erupt over other small issues, however, there was one final bombshell that would smash the already rocky relationship to pieces. This bombshell exploded when Taylor posted an Instagram story detailing her 'requirements' in a romantic partner, seemingly suggesting that Brandon didn't quite seal the deal for her.</p><p>When Brandon saw the story, he decided that this was the final straw. He no longer wanted to pursue the relationship. After just four weeks, their relationship was over.</p><p>However, this came as no surprise to fans, many of whom predicted that the fiery couple wouldn't last long term. One indicator of the inevitable end to their relationship was that alongside their constant bickering, they also didn't spend their one-month anniversary together, an event that would spell out doom for their future.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="'Married At First Sight': What Really Happened At Isabella And Tyler's Crazy Honeymoon Island Drama">'Married At First Sight': What Really Happened At Isabella And Tyler's Crazy Honeymoon Island Drama</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite not staying together as a couple, things would soon turn from bad to worse after the show came to an end. After parting ways, the couple had one more brutal altercation that took place in Washington D.C.</p><p>The two happened to bump into each other at a bar, where Taylor was accompanied by a new man. According to Distractify, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandon confronted Taylor and then continued to follow her</a> and her new man around as they left the bar.</p><p>Soon the police had been called, and the two were swiftly arrested after assault allegations were made.</p><p>After the fiery altercation had taken place, the two proceeded to obtain restraining orders against eachother, essentially slashing the other out of their lives for good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it is unclear exactly what happened, the two made it abundantly clear during the reunion episode of the show that they didn't want to see each other again.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Married At First Sight Couples Break Up Amid Rumors The Show Is Utterly Fake">Married At First Sight Couples Break Up Amid Rumors The Show Is Utterly Fake</a></span></p><p>However, it is not just Taylor and Brandon whose marriage didn't last. Plenty of <a href=#>other marriages from the show have since come to an abrupt end</a>. Jason and Courtney from Season 1 <a href=#>ended their marriage</a>, and so did <a href=#>Meka and Michael from Season 10</a>, who also had a more than sticky ending.</p><p>Despite being matched by professionals, it looks like not every pairing is a match made in heaven. However, this serves as better entertainment for many fans.</p><h2 id=what-is-taylor-dunklin-from-married-at-first-sight-doing-now>What Is Taylor Dunklin From Married At First Sight Doing Now?</h2><p>For Taylor, it appears as though she will never be looking back after experiencing such a tumultuous relationship on the show. However, that has left many fans of the show wondering what she is up to now?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Why Married At First Sight Season 15 Couples Signed Up For The Show">Why Married At First Sight Season 15 Couples Signed Up For The Show</a></span></p><p>For the most part, Taylor has kept relatively quiet since the show came to an end, keeping her social media activity minimized. She has also often been spotted by fans setting her Instagram profile to private on and off, which suggests she is toying with the idea of living a more private life.</p><p>Looking at her social media activity, we can now see that she is working at Johns Hopkins University in Washington D.C as a researcher.</p><p>Judging from her Instagram, it would also appear that she often goes traveling and spends plenty of quality time with her dog.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edOasKWnomKxtrrKpaCnZZanvK55zJqpq6GVmXqiwIyfoKurpGLAqrPHrWSdp5mjtG66zrBm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-rock-tells-the-cody-crybabies-to-shut-your-mouth-enjoy-the-ride-i-m-taking-you-on.html><span>←</span><span>The Rock Tells The Cody Crybabies To Shut Your Mouth, Enjoy The Ride Im Taking You On</span></a>
