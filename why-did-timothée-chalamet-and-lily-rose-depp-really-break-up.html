Were Timothée Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp serious about each other? And what caused them to go their separate ways? Keep on scrolling to find out!</p><h2 id=when-timoth-eacute-e-chalamet-and-lily-rose-depp-dated>When Timothée Chalamet And Lily-Rose Depp Dated</h2><p>Actors Timothée Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp presumably met on the set of the epic war movie The King whose filming started in June 2018. By September of that year, the two were spotted by a fan as they were taking a walk in Central Park in New York City which is when rumors of them dating started.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In October 2018 the two confirmed their relationship by sharing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a passionate kiss in the rain</a> — at the time Chalamet was 22 and Depp was 19 years old. Since then the two have been frequently spotted out and about together and in September 2019 the Timothée Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp made their red carpet debut at the Venice Film Festival. Unfortunately <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in early 2020</a>, it was reported that the couple parted ways.</p><h2 id=timoth-eacute-e-chalamet-and-lily-rose-depp-broke-up-because-of-quot-business-reasons-quot>Timothée Chalamet And Lily-Rose Depp Broke Up Because Of "Business Reasons"</h2><p>While no one ever gave a specific reason as to why Timothée Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp ended their relationship in the spring of 2020 — in that year's May issue of the British Vogue, Chalamet was "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">described as single</a>." This meant that the couple had broken up, but they never revealed why.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reportedly the two actors ended this relationship because of "business reasons" in April 2020 — which usually means their busy schedules wouldn't allow them to see each other much. This could be true as both of them had different projects they were working on at the time (Timothée Chalamet was filming the movies The French Dispatch, Dune, and Don't Look Up while Lily-Rose Depp was working on the movies Crisis, Voyagers, and Silent Night).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Lily-Rose Depp Battled This Horrible Disease And Fans Didn’t Even Know">Lily-Rose Depp Battled This Horrible Disease And Fans Didn’t Even Know</a></span></p><p>However, some do believe that the two have parted ways <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">because of the third person</a> but no one was ever named. After Timothée Chalamet, Lily-Rose Depp was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">linked to actor Austin Butler</a> however that was in 2021. Soon after his split from Depp, Chalamet was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">kissing Mexican actress Eiza González</a> who is six years older than the star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-timoth-eacute-e-chalamet-and-lily-rose-depp-get-back-together>Did Timothée Chalamet And Lily-Rose Depp Get Back Together?</h2><p>In the spring of 2021 (a year after their breakup), Timothée Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp were spotted hanging out together once again. The two would frequently step out together in New York City and on one occasion they were even seen shopping at a boutique. Here's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what an eyewitness who spotted thems at Verameat in the East Village</a> told Entertainment Tonight:</p><p>"They came in together and both looked around. Timothée has come into the store several times, both with Lily and alone. While Lily was looking at something outside, he bought it quickly for her as a secret gift and then ran out."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Here’s What Fans Think About Lily-Rose Depp’s Relationship With Vanessa Hudgen’s Ex-Boyfriend">Here’s What Fans Think About Lily-Rose Depp’s Relationship With Vanessa Hudgen’s Ex-Boyfriend</a></span></p><p>During an appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show in 2021, Lily-Rose Depp <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained why she won't comment on her love life</a>:</p><p>"The value of privacy is something that’s been instilled in me from an early age. Growing up in a family like I did, it was always something that was… I always learned the importance of privacy and valuing that and keeping things just for yourself. And so that’s something that I’ve carried on into my own career and that’s really important to me."</p><p>While the two stars were seen hanging out a lot at the time — there was no public display of affection which is something fans were used to seeing from them. This could however be because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that they were always seen wearing masks which certainly make making out in public more difficult.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Either way, by fall 2021, Timothée Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp have stopped being spotted together publicly, and it is unclear if they ever actually rekindled their romance, or they just hung out as friends. During the fall of 2021 and early 2022, Chalamet has been busy doing press tours for Dune and shooting the upcoming movie Wonka in Oxford, England. Lily-Rose Depp on the other hand has been doing promo for her latest movie Wolf, and she's been busy with a couple of modeling jobs. While Chalamet's dating life is a mystery at the moment, Lily-Rose Depp was recently spotted kissing French rapper Yassine Stein. So, it seems she and Chalamet may just be friends in 2022.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Timothée Chalamet Fans In Meme Frenzy After He Shared A Glimpse Of Himself As Willy Wonka">Timothée Chalamet Fans In Meme Frenzy After He Shared A Glimpse Of Himself As Willy Wonka</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbaledOipKismJp6pLTApZimnaRirq%2BwjKWgpbFdp7y0sYydnKmoXZe%2Fpq3KZqypZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-tiffany-dover-2022-age-husband-dustin-dover-and-death-is-she-dead.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Tiffany Dover 2022?
