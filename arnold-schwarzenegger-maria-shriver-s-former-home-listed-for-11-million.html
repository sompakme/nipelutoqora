The couple is being represented by Billy Rose and Santiago Arana of The Agency. According to the online listing, one of the biggest selling features of the property is its stunning location.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">French Montana Is Being Sued By Landscaper After Dog Attack</a></span></p><p>Situated in the Pacific Palisades, the home sits on a nearly-2-acre plot of land near Will Rogers Historical Park and Rustic Canyon Creek. There's plenty of natural scenery on and near the property, including several hiking and equestrian trails.</p><p>The home itself features 4,100 square feet of living space and comes with five bedrooms and six bathrooms. Its other features include a private tennis court and lagoon-style swimming pool with a spa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Schwarzenegger reportedly sold the home to the Kennedys following his divorce from Maria Shriver in 2011. The couple split following 25 years of <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">marriage</a> after it was revealed Schwarzenegger had fathered a son with a long-time household employee. The pair had previously purchased the home in the '80s and made it the primary home-based for them and their four children.</p><p>However, the exes were able to keep the estate in the family despite the divorce since Shriver is cousins with the home's current owner, Max Kennedy. His father, the late Robert F. Kennedy, was the brother of Shriver's mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver.</p><p>Shortly after purchasing the property, Kennedy put it up for rent. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Realtor</a> reports that it was once possible to rent the estate for a cool $35,000 a month, though the amount was later reduced to $20,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Schwarzenegger doesn't own this impressive <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pacific Palisades</a> home any longer, he has plenty of other lavish properties to his name.</p><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Love Property</a> reports that he also owns a home in Brentwood, Los Angeles, which has been his main residence since his divorce. The mansion is over 14,000 square feet and comes with seven bedrooms, ten bathrooms, a home gym, a backyard tennis court, and a swimming pool.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Schwarzenegger keeps plenty of unique pets on the sprawling property, including a miniature horse called Whiskey and a donkey named Lulu, both of whom have been featured on his social media accounts.</p><p>Schwarzenegger also reportedly has a vacation home in Idaho, which he purchased in the '90s. Not a lot of details are known about the private property, but the outlet reports it spans over 18,000 square feet. It features a lot of outdoor space and comes with a stunning view of the mountains.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande Sells Her Home For $14 Million After Living In It For A Year</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE Magazine</a>, <a href=#>Realtor</a>, <a href=#>Love Property</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSus7rOpZtmq5OdxKK%2B2Z6lnp%2BXmr9uucCroJplo52%2FqsLEq6pmnp%2Bnuqa%2BjKGmpp1doba0wMSdZJ%2BnomJ%2BcnnMoqOloZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./words-created-using-the-letters-in-policy.html><span>←</span><span>Words Created Using the Letters in 'policy'</span></a>
