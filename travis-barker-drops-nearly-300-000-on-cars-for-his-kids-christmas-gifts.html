The Blink-182 drummer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly spent nearly $300,000 on luxury cars</a> for his kids Landon and Alabama Barker.</p><p>Over Christmas, Alabama flaunted her father’s luxurious gift on social media, showcasing two black G-Wagons parker in the drive way of their family home. Two red bows adorned the cars, making clear they were a holiday present.</p><p>“What the f–k!” Alabama exclaimed in one of the clips as she and her older brother realized what their surprise was.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/kardashian-empire.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The Kardashian-Jenner clan, with around $2 billion in assets, built a sprawling empire by leveraging their fame and shrewd entrepreneurial skills.</span><p>The 2024 G-Wagon has a starting price of $140,000, but this can easily come pricier with add-ons and customizations. The drummer spent at least $280,000 on the present, which may only be pocket change for Travis, who has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported net worth of $50 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps it’s not surprising that Travis chose to gift cars for Christmas, considering he has an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">automotive collection worth an estimated $1 million</a>. Some of the rarest models in his collection G Wagen 4×4 Squared (worth at least $230,000) and a Rolls-Royce Cullinan (estimated to be $340,000).</p><p>His wife Kourtney also gifted him a 1987 Buick Grand National Experimental, showcasing that gifting cars isn’t unusual in the Kardashian-Jenner circle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/travis-barker-and-kourtney-kardashain.jpg><p>It was only a few Christmases ago that matriarch Kris Jenner surprised all of her adult children with matching cars. In 2021, Kim shared the electric Moke vehicles her mom splurged on, each one coming in a different color for one of her six kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Khloe [Kardashian] and I got the pink ones,” Kim explained in the clip, showing off light pink as well as hot pink options. The other colors included blue, orange, and white.</p><p>The cars start at $21,000 but can reach up to $30,000 with different customizations. It’s suspected <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kris spent at least $130,000 on the vehicles</a>.</p><p>Over-the-top Christmas gifts aren’t the only thing the Kardashians were criticized for this holiday season. Kim made waves for showcasing her elaborated Xmas decoration, which some fans argued was unnecessary and wasteful.</p><p>For example, after filling up a bathtub with chocolate for an Elf on the Shelf surprise for her kids, some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans couldn’t believe the mess Kim</a> had made, including how many ingredients she wasted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During another instance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim gave fans a tour of her home</a>, which included 100 real Christmas trees spread throughout the mansion. "That's sad. A lot of people aren't able to have a Christmas and you just flaunt your house full of trees, and you said real ones [and] that's a lot of oxygen that was removed from Mother Earth for you to have a house full of Christmas trees,” one critic wrote.</p><p>For now, Kim hasn’t responded to the controversy over her expensive Christmas décor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmraqRq7a0ecGaqaSdomKxs7vPrGRsaGBlfXF5wpqprGWbnrG0ecKhqaKrpKKutHnGop2tq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-10-angriest-coaches-in-sports.html><span>←</span><span>The 10 Angriest Coaches In Sports</span></a>
