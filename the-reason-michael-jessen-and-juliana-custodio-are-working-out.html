There are some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pairings whose breakups shock fans, and others that are easy to see coming</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Couples get together and split up faster than viewers can blink, while some relationships that no one thought would last wind up going the distance.&nbsp;The latter is apparently true of Michael Jessen and Juliana Custodio.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'90 Day Fiancé': Who Was Juliana Custodio Before Meeting Michael?</a></span></p><p>Fans were drawn in by the couple's story: the two met on a yacht where Juliana was modeling, and throughout their courtship, Michael flexed his wealth. But their age gap, as well as&nbsp;the amount of cash Michael admitted to spending on Juliana, had fans shaking their heads.</p><p>Though some other '90 Day' couples wound up falling apart after it came out that one half or the other was being dishonest, some couples really do stick it out and get married, start families, and just generally live happy lives together. It's easy for fans to be cynical, but at this point, it seems like Michael and Juliana might just be in it for the long haul.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering how they met and began dating, it's understandable that viewers have questions (and concerns).</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CheatSheet</a>&nbsp;explained that Juliana had a rough personal life before becoming a model and later meeting Michael Jessen. But after the two became a couple, Michael shared his wealth with his lady love; TLC producers pegged him at having spent around $100K to $150K on Juliana, including the cost of cars and anything else she wanted while still living in Brazil.</p><p>The couple later went on to get married, though, seemingly proving naysayers wrong. And they do seem to be working out, which has some critics (and a few fans, TBH) wondering why.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The short answer is that the two seem to have a genuine relationship.</p><p>In fact, as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SoapDirt</a>&nbsp;recounted, Michael's ex-wife, Sarah Jessen (who is now remarried) swears that Michael and Juliana's marriage is legit. She even seemingly broke the NDA she'd had with TLC to explain that the entire scene where the trio discussed Michael and Juliana's prenup was totally fabricated.</p><p>Michael Jessen had also claimed that TLC scripted that scene and forced the bride and groom to talk about a prenup when they never planned on having one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Further, Sarah explained that she knew Michael and Juliana were truly in love and weren't marrying for money (or any other reason). With his ex-wife's complete endorsement, it seems like true love is the likeliest explanation for how this particular '90 Day' couple is still together and making their relationship work.</p><p>And Sarah has the utmost confidence that Juliana is&nbsp;not&nbsp;after Michael's money.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Filming Secrets About 90 Day Fiancé</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhwaWWUlsZussiapZydXay1unnMopqhmZWhequx0qycp2Waqrmqrc2aZJyto6m8pbXOZq6oqptk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-highest-grossing-albums-of-alicia-keys-ranked.html><span>←</span><span>The Highest-Grossing Albums Of Alicia Keys, Ranked</span></a>
