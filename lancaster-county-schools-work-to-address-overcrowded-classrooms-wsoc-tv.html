The new high school is only two or three years old, and already again, we are close to capacity,” Watts said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The committee said it would create a list, that could impact the bond referendum that leaders plan to put on the ballot next spring.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“In a nutshell, people are saying we need new schools in Indian land,” Watts explained.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">However, there are some residents, like Karen Garcia, who may decide to vote no to any bond. “Right now, I’m not really sure. It’s kind of a toss-up for me because I don’t really have kids, so,” Garcia said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Other residents said they are concerned about the tax rate and money being distributed fairly.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Watts said she is hopeful that voters will consider what is more important when heading to the ballot box. “We want to keep the education, the safety of our kids first, and that’s what’s most important,” Watts explained.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The Facility Needs Committee is slated to finalize its list by the new year.
