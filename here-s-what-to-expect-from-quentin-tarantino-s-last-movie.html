One can even say that Tarantino films are a genre on their own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the longest time,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tarantino has said that once he makes his 10th film, he will retire</a>&nbsp;from filmmaking. Last year's&nbsp;Once Upon A Time In Hollywood&nbsp;was his ninth motion picture. What can we expect from Tarantino's last movie? The legendary filmmaker has often surprised his fans with versatile and non-linear storytelling.</p><p>Tarantino has made movies about crime, drama, action, spaghetti westerns, black comedy, and his most recent, alternate history. In a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter</a>, Tarantino said his final film will be "epilogue-y."</p><p>He said&nbsp;"If you think about the idea of all the movies telling one story and each film is like a train boxcar connected to each other, this one would sort of be the big showstopping climax of it all," He didn't mention much more after that, but that's the beauty of Tarantino films, you watch it expecting the unexpected, and are often on the edge of your seat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-can-we-expect-his-final-film>When Can We Expect His Final Film?</h2><p>There are filmmakers who make movies almost every year and there are some who take years in between to make their next one. Tarantino falls somewhere in between. It took him 4 years between his 8th film&nbsp;The Hateful 8&nbsp;and&nbsp;Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.&nbsp;But it only took him a year apart to make both the&nbsp;Kill Bill&nbsp;movies in 2003 and 2004.</p><p>Basically there is no way of telling when his next film will even start production. You could get up tomorrow and there might be reports that he's started filming or it could be 5 years down the line and production may not have even started. The anticipation begins.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Quentin Tarantino Films, Ranked By Money Made</a></span></p><h2 id=which-tarantinoverse-will-it-be>Which Tarantinoverse Will It Be?</h2><p>Before the arrival of the Marvel Universe and the DC Universe, there was the Tarantinoverse. His big-screen continuity began with the connection of&nbsp;Reservoir Dogs&nbsp;Vic Vega and&nbsp;Pulp Fictions&nbsp;Vincent Vega. They were brothers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Tarantinoverse is unique in that there are actually two universes. The main universe is in movies like&nbsp;Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.&nbsp;Then there are the movies that exist within that main universe like&nbsp;Grindhouse, Jackie Brown,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Kill Bill&nbsp;movies.&nbsp;Every Tarantino movie has this uniqueness and it's intriguing to see if he ties his last "epilogue-y" movie to these two Tarantinoverses.</p><p>It will also be interesting to find out what genre his last film will be. He started out in the 90s making only crime drama movies like&nbsp;Reservoir Dogs&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pulp Fiction. He even wrote screenplays for crime drama movies like&nbsp;Natural Born Killers&nbsp;and&nbsp;True Romance.&nbsp;But since the start of the new century, he has been quite eclectic in shaping the genre of his films.&nbsp;Tarentino's gone from a kung fu flick to a war movie, and then from a western to period dramas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No matter what genre, sub-genre, or new genre it will be, it's certain to stimulate all your senses. It will be provocative and it'll only allow room for thought only days after you have watched it.</p><h2 id=the-legacy-of-a-great-storyteller>The Legacy Of A Great Storyteller</h2><p>Tarantino films have often garnered high praise, but at the same time&nbsp;they have been criticized for&nbsp;scenes of extreme violence, particularly towards women. Tarantino has also been criticized for putting one of his female stars, Uma Thurman in harm's way on the set of&nbsp;Kill Bill.&nbsp;Many of his movies have been financed and produced by disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>It has been reported that Tarantino regrets the incident involving Thurman. He has also said that he has pushed back against Weinstein but has admitted that it wasn't enough at the time of those incidences. The incident Tarantino was referring too was Weinstein's harassment of actress Mira Sorvino. In a time of change in an industry that needs wholesale change, directors like Tarantino are moving with the times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Audiences and critics have polarizing views on Tarantino. But before the entertainment industry reached its current crossroads, directors like Tarantino were creating and writing complex characters for women and actors of color. Before Wonder Woman was reinvented there was The Bride from&nbsp;Kill Bill&nbsp;and Jackie Brown from&nbsp;Jackie Brown.&nbsp;This does not excuse any indiscretions if there were any at all.</p><p>Tarantino's legacy is that he has constantly pushed filmmaking to its edge to create thought-provoking and highly entertaining cinematic masterpieces. He is truly a filmmaker's filmmaker who understands the history and power of cinema.</p><p>While we wait for his final movie Tarantino is working on a television spin-off miniseries,&nbsp;Bounty Law,&nbsp;which is the fictional western series in his last movie&nbsp;Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.&nbsp;There are also talks of Tarantino's movie&nbsp;The Hateful 8&nbsp;being turned into a play. Whatever his next project is, it will be awaited with high anticipation. It will be his last, so let's savor every frame and moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quentin Tarantino Talks 'Once Upon A Time in Hollywood'...
