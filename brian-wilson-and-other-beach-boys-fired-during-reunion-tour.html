The 50th Reunion Tour was designed to be a set tour with a beginning and an end to mark a special 50-year milestone for the band,” read a statement issued by Love. The announcement comes five days after the band celebrated their five-decade career at the Grammy Museum opening in Los Angeles.</p><p>“I’m disappointed and can’t understand why he doesn’t want to tour with Al, David and me,” Wilson told <a href=# rel=nofollow>CNN</a>. “We are out there having so much fun. After all, we are the real Beach Boys.” Love will continue touring as the Beach Boys with Bruce Johnson and a back-up band.</p><p>The band, known most for their laid-back “Kokomo” lyrics, has also become well-known for their sporadic spats. If all else fails, they can always sub in <a href=# rel=nofollow>“Full House” star John Stamos</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e%2Fqq3NZq6ipKOku26tzZ1kqKyYmr9ursSamqFlkqTGtHnFoqmenF2ZwrO1zaBkq52lo7awuoytpq6qXWZ%2BdHyQamY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./women-of-the-hour-12-most-powerful-women-in-global-entertainment.html><span>←</span><span>Women Of The Hour: 12 Most Powerful Women In Global Entertainment</span></a>
