After the coronavirus pandemic forced the couple to delay their nuptials, the cast threw a ceremonial wedding at the Hamptons house on Thursday’s finale. As for the real wedding, the tension among the cast has been whether <strong><a href=#>Hannah Berner</a> </strong>will make the guest list as she feuds with the groom.</p><p>“I got uninvited [and then] invited. People put it over my head, like, ‘Do you deserve to go to the wedding?’ I just want everyone to be happy. I want everyone to find love,” Hannah told Us on Tuesday, April 20. “All I’ve heard them talk terrible about <a href=#>[my fiancé] <strong>Des [Bishop]</strong> now.</a> So, I’m just like, ‘Leave me alone. I’ve reacted and I’m sorry for getting upset about things. I don’t know what more you guys want from me.’”</p><p>The season 5 finale of Summer House airs on Bravo Thursday, April 22, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqupZ2av260zq6qnmWWnruiuMRmmKaZnpmubrfYpZxmmaOgerGtyKCcZpuRp7luwM5mmZ5lmaN6uLHDnaCnn18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sophia-bush-reveals-which-one-tree-hill-scene-she-hated-the-most.html><span>←</span><span>Sophia Bush Reveals Which One Tree Hill Scene She Hated the Most</span></a>
