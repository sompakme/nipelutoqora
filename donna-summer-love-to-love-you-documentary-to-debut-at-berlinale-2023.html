She had a voice that<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234649767> spoke to my soul </a>on the dance floor.&nbsp;To be able to tell her story from a very personal perspective and to do that with her brilliant daughter Brooklyn is a dream come true.

Other smash hits like “I Feel Love,” “Last Dance,” “Bad Girls,” and “Hot Stuff” earned her the moniker, Queen of Disco. Summer died of lung cancer in 2012 at age 63.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Polygram’s David Blackman spoke on their obtained footage with <a href=#>Deadline</a>. “It’s amazing what the family has,” he explained. “Donna was an early pioneer of taping herself, so she has just amazing home video of all these family moments, of her playing the piano while their kids are running around–this stuff that isn’t just about performance footage.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Blackman added, “At the end of the day, we trust our filmmakers to make the best movies possible. Before we make our movie, there’s a lot of conversation about what the movie is going to be and what we’re trying to go after in a kind of emotionally resonant way. And I think that building of trust between the estate or the living [artist] and the filmmaker is a key part of <a href=#>making the documentary successful</a>.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Berlinale, formally known as the Berlin International Film Festival, will run from Feb. 16-26, 2023.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m8r7rAZqqupZ2av26wzpyspp2eqa6zxYylpq%2BdXam8brjOr5xmsZ%2BqenJ%2Bkm1ubGhpbYFw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./directors-with-billion-dollar-movies-under-their-name.html><span>←</span><span>Directors With Billion Dollar Movies Under Their Name</span></a>
