In the image, her locks were smoothed down and dyed in a stunning <a href=#>rose gold shade</a>. She gazed into the camera while posing with her hand resting on her forehead. For glam, she slayed pink cheeks, glossy lips and <a href=#>minimal eye makeup</a>. Her eyebrows were perfectly manicured and filled in and she showed off her natural complexion.</p><p>Pinkett Smith accessorized with silver hoop earrings, a black<a href=#> turtleneck sweater</a> and long almond-shaped nails. “This ain’t noth’n but a birthday sherbet surprise within a Virgo sunrise✨🎉,” she captioned the post.</p><p>Celebrity friends including <a href=#><strong>Kerry Washington</strong></a>,<a href=#><strong> Tiffany Haddish</strong></a>,<strong> Terri Vaughn</strong> and more celebrated by commenting “happy birthday” messages. More fans praised her new hair color and wrote, “Love the new color sis.” A second added, “Ooh, this rose gold like haute on you, honeeeeey.” A third gushed, “That color is EVERYTHANG!”</p><p>This past summer Pinkett Smith shared an update on <a href=#>her hair growth journey</a> via Instagram. In the first photo, Pinkett Smith donned a freshly shaved head, but when fans swiped through the carousel, they saw a<a href=#> bleach blonde pixie cut</a>. “This here hair is act’n like it’s try’n a make a come back,” she captioned the post. “Still have some trouble spots but — we’ll see✨.”</p><p>Through the years, Pinkett Smith has been open about her struggles with alopecia, a disease that causes hair loss. She first started experiencing the condition in 2018. That same year, she shared how “terrified” she felt “when it first started” in a May 2018 episode of her Facebook Watch show,<a href=#> Red Table Talk</a>. “I was in the shower one day and had just handfuls of hair in my hands and I was just like, ‘Oh, my God, am I going bald?’”</p><p>In February 2023, she opened up to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Guardian</a> about her refound beauty standards after losing her hair. “Specifically, as Black women, we identify so much of ourselves with our hair,” she said. “It was scary. I had to really dig deep and see the beauty of myself beyond my aesthetics.”</p><p>Pinkett Smith’s buzz cut made headlines at the <a href=#>2022 Oscars</a> when <a href=#><strong>Chris Rock</strong></a> — who hosted the awards show — seemingly joked about her shaved head. “Jada, I love you. ‘G.I. Jane 2,’ can’t wait to see it,” he said, referencing the character’s famous short hair.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Although she initially rolled her eyes at the comment, husband <a href=#><strong>Will Smith</strong></a> then defended his wife and slapped Rock, 58, <a href=#>across the face</a>. “Leave my wife’s name out of your f—king mouth,” he said while sitting back down.</p><p>Will, 54, <a href=#>apologized the next day</a> for his actions and announced his resignation from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Science. Subsequently, the Academy<a href=#> banned Smith from attending </a>all Oscars events for 10 years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2Bupa2MqaCno5WpwW6%2FzKKroWWlo8OmtcusZKuno5p6qLvLnWShmZmneqe70Wafnqpdl7azwMedmLJn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./follow-him-podcast-episodes-host-and-latest-news.html><span>←</span><span>Follow Him Podcast Episodes, Host and Latest News</span></a>
