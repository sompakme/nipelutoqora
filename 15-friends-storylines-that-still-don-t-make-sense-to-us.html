After all, it still has a following. At the same time, it’s hard to forget that this was quite the award-winning show. For starters, it achieved 10 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Globes</a> nominations and one win. Meanwhile, the show also garnered 62 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmy </a>nominations and six wins, including Outstanding Comedy Series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Much of the show’s success is also due to its stellar cast. This includes Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, and David Schwimmer. Throughout the show’s 10 seasons, their chemistry was undeniable.</p><p>Over the years, the show gave us some of the most hilarious and heartwarming stories, too. Nonetheless, that doesn’t mean that all storylines were easy to understand. In fact, some are still messing with our heads today.</p><h2 id=the-one-where-monica-s-apartment-number-gets-changed><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>The One Where Monica’s Apartment Number Gets Changed</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monicas-Apartment-Number-via-whatculture.com_.jpg><p>In some episodes, Monica’s place has been shown as apartment number five. However, for some inexplicable reason, the same place became apartment number 20 over the course of the show. On the other hand, Chandler and Joey’s apartment number also changed from four to 19. There was never any explanation, so perhaps the crew is just messing with us.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-one-where-rachel-is-an-aquarius-who-celebrates-her-birthday-in-may><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>The One Where Rachel Is An Aquarius Who Celebrates Her Birthday In May</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rachel-Birthday-via-businessinsider.sg_.png><p>During the season four episode entitled “The One with Joey’s New Girlfriend,” Rachel informs Gunther that her birthday is May 5. However, during the season seven episode “The One with Chandler’s Dad,” Rachel gets <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pulled over</a>. And as a cop studies her license, he remarks, “You’re an Aquarius, huh?” That certainly means that her birthday can’t be in May.</p><h2 id=the-one-where-everyone-s-ages-get-mixed-up><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>The One Where&nbsp;Everyone's Ages Get Mixed Up</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ages-via-friends.fandom.com_.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For instance, Ross seems to have stayed 29 years old from seasons three to five. And then, there’s an episode where Rachel is supposed to be the last one in the gang to turn 30. That would essentially mean that she’s the youngest. However, we learned in season one that Joey was the youngest of the group.</p><h2 id=the-one-where-phoebe-s-mom-suddenly-disappeared-after-season-five><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>The One Where Phoebe’s Mom Suddenly Disappeared After Season Five</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Phoebes-mom-via-friends.fandom.com_.jpg><p>There was a time on the show where they were setting up Phoebe’s story arc to include her mother. And while it was fun to see Phoebe find her and get reunited with her, we also couldn’t help but notice that she disappeared completely eventually. In fact, Phoebe even stopped mentioning her altogether.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look At How Chandler From ‘Friends’ Was Affected By Mathew Perry’s Struggles</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-one-where-no-one-knows-what-happened-to-ben><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>The One Where No One Knows What Happened To Ben</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ben-via-thesun.co_.uk_.jpg><p>Especially during the initial seasons of the show, Ross’ son with Carol, Ben,&nbsp;was featured a lot in the episodes. And if he wasn’t around, Ross would mention his only son from time to time. However, later on, it’s like Ben just completely disappeared after appearing in a season eight episode. We don’t even know if he's met Emma.</p><h2 id=the-one-where-ross-claims-to-hate-ice-cream><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The One Where Ross Claims To Hate Ice Cream</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ross-Ice-Cream-via-cosmopolitan.com_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In one episode, Ross makes the claim that he doesn’t like ice cream. He then says it’s “too cold.” However, during earlier seasons, we saw Ross enjoying this frozen treat with his young girlfriend, Elizabeth. Moreover, we also saw Ross enjoy a cone while hanging out with his monkey, Marcel.</p><h2 id=the-one-where-phoebe-speaks-french-but-fails-to-understand-it><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The One Where Phoebe Speaks French, But Fails To Understand&nbsp;It</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Phoebe-French-via-factswt.com_.jpg><p>Among the gang, Phoebe is believed to be the only one capable of speaking French fluently. In fact, she even gives Joey lessons in the season 10 episode “The One Where Joey Speaks French.” However, in the season eight episode “The One with Rachel’s Date,” Phoebe doesn’t know what sous-chef means.</p><h2 id=the-one-about-chandler-being-unable-to-cry><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The One About Chandler Being Unable To Cry</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chandler-Cant-Cry-via-moviedb.org_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At one point, the show even made a big deal about this storyline, going so far as to name an episode “The One Where Chandler Can’t Cry.” If you could recall, the gang tried to get an emotional response from Chandler, but failed spectacularly. However, during an earlier season, Phoebe mentioned that she made Chandler “cry like a baby.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprising BTS Facts About Chandler On Friends</a></span></p><h2 id=the-one-where-phoebe-was-claiming-to-have-a-roommate-named-denise><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The One Where Phoebe Was Claiming To Have A Roommate Named Denise</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Phoebe-Denise-via-lifeandstylemag.com_.jpg><p>During the show’s sixth season, Phoebe claimed that she had a roommate named Denise. And when Rachel needed a new place to stay after Monica and Chandler moved in together, Phoebe said Rachel couldn’t stay with her because of Denise. But then, Denise supposedly moved out and Rachel moved in. After that, we’re not sure what happened to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-one-where-rachel-and-chandler-don-t-seem-to-remember-that-they-already-met-prior-to-her-unexpected-arrival><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The One Where Rachel And Chandler Don’t Seem To Remember That They Already Met Prior To Her Unexpected Arrival</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rachel-and-Chandler-via-twitter.com_.jpg><p>The show’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pilot episode</a> brought the whole gang together for the first time after Rachel ran out of her own wedding. After arriving at Central Perk, Monica proceeds to introduce Rachel to everybody. During this time, Chandler and Rachel acted like they&nbsp;had never met before. However, flashback scenes clearly show that they’ve met a few times.</p><h2 id=the-one-where-carol-was-supposed-to-be-the-first-woman-ross-slept-with><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The One Where Carol Was Supposed To Be The First Woman Ross Slept With</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Carol-via-bustle.com_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During one episode in the show’s first season, Ross confesses that Carol was the only woman that he had slept with at that time.

However, when the show returned for its sixth season, the newly married couple was seen without any ink as they met the rest of the gang for breakfast.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things Friends Fans Should Know About HBO’s Reunion Special</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-one-where-ross-and-rachel-s-pride-got-in-the-way-of-their-relationship-for-almost-10-years><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The One Where Ross And Rachel’s Pride Got In The Way Of Their Relationship For Almost 10 Years</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ross-and-Rachel-via-glamour.com_.jpg><p>Perhaps, one of the most confusing storylines of the show is the one pertaining to Ross and Rachel’s relationship history. In the beginning, the two admitted their feelings for each other but then, Ross thinks they broke up, although Rachel didn’t. And somehow, this resulted in the two being apart for nearly ten years.</p><h2 id=the-one-where-rachel-gave-up-paris-for-ross><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The One Where Rachel Gave Up Paris For Ross</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rachel-Ross-Paris-via-insider.com_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the show’s finale, Rachel made the decision to move to Paris so that she could start her new job with Louis Vuitton.
