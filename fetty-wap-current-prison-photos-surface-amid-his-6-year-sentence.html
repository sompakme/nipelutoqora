The 32-year-old didn’t even get to hit the stage, as the FBI recovered 16 kilograms of cocaine, two kilograms of heroin, fentanyl pills, two 9mm handguns, a rifle, a .45 caliber pistol, a .40 caliber pistol, ammunition, and $1.5 million in cash.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Reportedly, the “My Way” rapper was accused of running a drug ring out of Long Island, and allegedly helping traffic large amounts of opioids, crack, and cocaine from the West Coast. Fetty ultimately pled guilty to “conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine” and was sentenced to six years, instead of the seven to nine year request made by prosecution.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-607550168.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Young people who admire the defendant and are considering selling drugs need to be sent a message that selling drugs is not a glamorous lifestyle and, if they participate in that trade, they will receive lengthy prison sentences,” stated Breon Peace, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Two months ago, Fetty shared a photo of himself on Instagram with the caption, “FREE ZOO #1738.” He followed up with an IG Story saying, “Real made men double M inna spot.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5uytcDYZq6aqF2lv6q%2FzqdkqaCfqby0eZVmsJ6ZomLAprrTnqWcnV1mf3SAlnJvcWlpZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dresses-and-jumpsuits-that-will-cinch-and-highlight-your-waist.html><span>←</span><span>Dresses and Jumpsuits That Will Cinch and Highlight Your Waist</span></a>
