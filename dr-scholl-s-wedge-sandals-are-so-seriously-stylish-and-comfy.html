When most people think of the Dr. Scholl’s brand, they don’t necessarily envision trendy and fabulous footwear. Many are likely to immediately bring up their famous gel inserts, or a signature&nbsp;pair of shoes that’s primarily intended to support weary feet.

You would never guess that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this pair of sandals</a> is produced by the brand! Not only are they fashionable, but they are some of the most comfortable wedges on the market today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Dr.-Scholls-Barton-Black-Ventura-Snake-Print.jpg><p>Dr. Scholl’s Barton (Black Ventura Snake Print)</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class=Ls>Dr. Scholl’s&nbsp;</span></a><span class=Ms><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Barton</a> <a href=# data-link=1>sandals</a> with free shipping for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$50</a>, available from Zappos!</span></strong></p><p>These <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">strappy wedge sandals</a> were designed with complete comfort in mind. The straps are lined with ultra-smooth material, and run from the top of the toes to the ankles. There’s an adjustable buckle at the top, and the loop has an added insert that helps keep the strap in place. These sandals <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">have a platform</a> that measures 3/4 inch, and heel that’s 2 inches high. In total, you’re snagging an extra 3 inches — but it will feel like you’re wearing a flat!</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, the Dr. Scholl’s brand is probably most notable for their plush sole inserts. Luckily, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">these sandals</a> already come equipped with a contoured, padded and cushiony footbed so that you’re all set! In terms of everyday wearability, our expectations are high — and reviewers say <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">that these wedges</a> will live up to them!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Dr.-Scholls-Barton-Oxide-Snake-Print.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class=Ls>Dr. Scholl’s&nbsp;</span></a><span class=Ms><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Barton</a> sandals with free shipping for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$50</a>, available from Zappos!</span></strong></p><p>One shopper says that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">these shoes</a> are “the most comfortable sandals” that they have ever owned. They added that they brought these shoes on a trip that involved “walking 10 [or more] miles a day,” and felt “zero pain or discomfort” when all was said and done. If that’s not impressive enough, there are plenty more reviews that echo the same sentiments. Others say that “the shoe is almost weightless,” which is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">amazing for wedges </a>— and that they were “very comfy out of the box”!</p><p>These sandals come in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">five different neutral tones</a>: charcoal grey, dark green, black, light beige and camel brown. The shade of the heel depends on which sandal you pick, but they are all coordinated beautifully. These shoes check off all of our boxes when it comes to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">perfect summer sandal</a>: simple, stylish and endlessly comfy!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class=Ls>Dr. Scholl’s&nbsp;</span></a><span class=Ms><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Barton</a> sandals with free shipping for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$50</a>, available from Zappos!</span></strong></p><p><strong>Not what you’re looking for?
