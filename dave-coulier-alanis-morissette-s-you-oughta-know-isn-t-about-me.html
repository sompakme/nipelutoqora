First of all, the guy in that song is a real a-hole, so I don’t want to be that guy. Secondly, I asked Alanis, ‘I’m getting calls by the media and they want to know who this guy is.’ And she said, ‘Well, you know it could be a bunch of people. But you can say whatever you want.'”</p><p class=p1>“One time, I was doing a red carpet somewhere and [the press] just wore me down and everybody wanted to know so I said, ‘Yeah, all right, I’m the guy. There I said it.’ So then it became a snowball effect of, ‘OH! So you are the guy!'” he continued. “It’s just become this silly urban legend that I just have to laugh at.”</p><p class=p1>The track, which hit No. 6 on the Billboard Top 10 and helped to make Morissette an international star and household name, has her singing, “You seem very well, things look peaceful / I’m not quite as well, I thought you should know / Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity / I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner / It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced / Are you thinking of me when you f–k her?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Coulier referenced that specific verse in a <a href=# rel=noopener>September interview with HuffPost Live</a>, where he admitted the song may be about him.</p><p class=p1>“There was a lot of familiar stuff because she was writing a lot of material when we were dating, so there were some familiarities all throughout Jagged Little Pill,” Coulier explained about “You Oughta Know” and its lyrics. “The one that got me was, “I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner.” That was because we had already broken up and she had called—she was living in Canada at the time—she called, and I said, ‘Hey, I’m right in the middle of dinner, can I just call you right back?’ I remember that line when I heard ‘You Oughta Know,’ and I just went… it was like, ‘uh oh.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuarpVisLDBy6Kcq2WRoa6vtdJmpKiqmajApsDTnqpmsZ%2BqerDBxqGrmmWbo7y4ecispa1lkZe8tsCMppxmamBmgXaCjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-bassitt-brother-who-is-matt-bassitt-meet-him-on-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Bassitt Brother- Who Is Matt Bassitt?
