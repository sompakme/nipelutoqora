<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>FRSC Salary Structure, Ranks and Departments</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The FRSC is an agency that regulates and maintains safety to avoid accidents on Nigerian roads. The commission is saddled with the responsibility of ensuring accident-free roads by enlightening road users and enforcing appropriate road precautions.</p><p>FRSC officers, who are amongst the well-paid paramilitary agencies, are recruited into the different ranks according to their qualifications. The FRSC salary structure is arranged according to the qualifications and ranks of officers in their various departments. The FRSC ranking system is divided into commissioned and non-commissioned officers. The departments in the paramilitary body are further divided into 8, ranging from the operations department to the technical service department.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-frsc-salary-structure></span><strong>What is FRSC Salary Structure?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>FRSC is one of the paramilitary agencies in Nigeria. Their salary structure is based on a consolidated salary scale. Being an agency on a consolidated salary scale implies that the staff of the agency is remunerated based on their rank, years of experience, contributions, and achievements. The FRSC salary structure of officers is not the same as that of the marshals in the commission.</p><p>Efforts to access the salary structure of the commission were not successful. However, some available information confirmed that the current salary structure of FRSC entry-level staff is in the range of N40,000 to N90,000 for O’level certificate holders. B.Sc. and HND holders in various ranks earn monthly salaries ranging from N100,000 to 120,000. The cadre of the commission earns N200,000 and above monthly.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=basic-annual-salary-of-the-staff-of-frsc></span><strong>Basic Annual Salary of the Staff of FRSC</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The salary listed below excludes other benefits and allowances due to staff of the FRSC.</p><ul><li>Chief Inspector (CI)-N1,405,449</li><li>Deputy Chief Inspector (DCI)-N1,325,234</li><li>Assistant Chief Inspector (ACI)-N1,252,038</li><li>Principal Marshal Inspector (PMI)-N1,143,539</li><li>Senior Marshal Inspector (SMI)-N1,058,416</li><li>Marshal Inspector I (MI-I)-N777,876</li><li>Marshal Inspector II (MI-II)-N548,387</li><li>Marshal Inspector III (MI-III)-N393,442</li><li>Chief Road Marshal Assistant (CRMA)-N966,761</li><li>Deputy Road Marshal Assistant (DRMA)-N539,048</li><li>Senior Road Marshal Assistant (SRMA)-N387,428</li><li>Road Marshal Assistant I (RMA I)-N349,589</li><li>Road Marshal Assistant II (RMA II)-N319,741</li><li>Road Marshal Assistant III (RMA III)-N305,576</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=other-welfare-and-benefits-of-the-staff-of-frsc></span><strong>Other Welfare and Benefits of the Staff of FRSC</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The salary structure of FRSC is accompanied by other benefits. Allowances and other benefits also increase as the rank and level of the staff of the commission increase. For instance, a deputy corps commander and deputy corps marshal can not have the same allowance and other benefits structure.</p><p>Below are the other benefits the staff of the commission enjoys in the service:</p><h4><strong>1. Housing</strong></h4><p>The Federal Road Safety Corps launched the FRSC Housing Cooperative plan in June 2004, with the goal of providing housing benefits to its employees. The idea for this housing scheme arose from a desire to assist employees who also contribute to the National Housing Fund (NHF) in obtaining loans from the Federal Mortgage Bank and become proud homeowners where they will retire.</p><h4><strong>2. Cooperative Society</strong></h4><p>Another unique element of the FRSC is its cooperative society, which enables members to obtain loans, save money, and purchase things at reduced prices from reliable sources. The cooperative can provide a list of certified automotive brands at discounted prices to interested employees.</p><h4><strong>3. Special Marshal Welfare</strong></h4><p>There is also an insurance policy in place to cover special road marshals who die in car accidents; the act also includes immunities for their protection. This immunity clause protects the special marshal from accountability for any legitimate act performed by the person assigned to the route.</p><p>In addition to all of these advantages, members of the Federal Road Safety Corps receive uniforms to help them carry out their noble tasks.</p><h4><strong>4. Health Care</strong></h4><p>The FRSC offers healthcare to both its employees and traffic accident victims. In total, the commission has established 12 zone clinics, 20 highway clinics, and one clinic at its headquarters. The health care workers in these clinics include 23 certified medical doctors, 121 registered nurses, 57 support staff, and 51 paramedics who are in charge of running the clinics.</p><p>Enrollment in the National Health Insurance Scheme is another health benefit available to FRSC members. Both the serving corps and their family members are covered under the insurance system.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=breakdown-of-federal-road-safety-commission-frsc-ranks></span><strong>Breakdown of Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) Ranks</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the commission, the ranks of recruited staff are segmented into two categories. One is the road marshal and the other is the officer rank level. These two categories are recruited based on two different scales, and so are their functions. Below is the list of all the ranks according to their different categories:</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=frsc-officers-ranks></span><strong>FRSC Officers Ranks</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The ranks in the officer cadre are the highest level of ranks in the commission. The staff in this cadre are regarded as senior officers in the commission. Assistant route commander is the entry rank of officers in the commission and they are likely to grow to the highest rank, which is Corps marshal. Below is the list of the ranks in the FRSC Officers’ level:</p><ul><li>Corps Marshal-CM</li><li>Deputy Corps Marshal-DCM</li><li>Assistant Corps Marshal-ACM</li><li>Corps Commander-CC</li><li>Deputy Corps Commander-DCC</li><li>Assistant Corps Commander-ACC</li><li>Chief Route Commander-CRC</li><li>Superintendent Route-SRC</li><li>Route Commander-RC</li><li>Deputy Route Commander-DRC</li><li>Assistant Route Commander-ARC</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=frsc-ranks></span><strong>FRSC Ranks</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Marshal ranks are the second category of ranks in the commission. This category is further divided into three sections. As one grows and gets promoted in the commission, they are moved to the higher section of this rank category. Below are the sections in the FRSC marshal ranks category:</p><h4><strong>Junior Marshals</strong></h4><ul><li>Chief Road Marshal Assistant-CRMA</li><li>Deputy Chief Road Marshal Assistant-DCRMA</li><li>Senior Road Marshal Assistant-SRMA</li><li>Road Marshal Assistant I-RMA I</li><li>Road Marshal Assistant II-RMA II</li><li>Road Marshal Assistant III- RMA III</li></ul><h4><strong>Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs)</strong></h4><ul><li>Marshal Inspector I- MI-I</li><li>Marshal Inspector II- MI-II</li><li>Marshal Inspector III- MI-III</li></ul><h4><strong>Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs)</strong></h4><ul><li>Chief Inspector-CI</li><li>Deputy Chief Inspector-DCI</li><li>Assistant Chief Inspector-ACI</li><li>Principal Marshal Inspector-PMI</li><li>Senior Marshal Inspector-SMI</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-departments-does-frsc-have></span><strong>How Many Departments Does FRSC Have?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There are 8 departments in the Federal Road Safety Commission of Nigeria.
