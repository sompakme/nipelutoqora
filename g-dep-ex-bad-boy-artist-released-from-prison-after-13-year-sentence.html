Dep</a> was finally released from prison on Thursday (April 4).&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a>&nbsp;reports that the ex-<a href=# id=auto-tag_bad-boy data-tag=bad-boy>Bad Boy</a> artist was released after serving 13 years behind bars for murder. Upon his release, Dep shared various videos documenting his journey back home. The rapper can be seen in the first video greeting his family and friends. “I told you I was bringing you home, right?”<a href=#> a woman can be heard lovingly saying</a> in the video before embracing him with a hug.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A follow-up video shows him hitting a local IHop where he relishes being “free at last.” He holds up a diner menu while giving thanks to his family again, showing gratitude to his fans and supporters over the years. G caps off the flurry of posts with a picture of himself posing in IHop with the word “Back” sprawled across the picture.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Dep, né Trevell Coleman, was initially arrested in 2010 after he confessed to a murder. He robbed and murdered a John Doe in 1993. A man named John Henkel was also fatally shot during an East Harlem robbery that year. In the years since then, Coleman claimed to be “haunted” by his actions. 2010 found Dep confessing to his crime, seeking <a href=#>forgiveness from God</a> in <a href=#>pursuit of becoming a new man</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>CBS</a>, while he did acknowledge the shooting during the trial, the rapper argued that police may have<a href=#> slapped the Henkel cold case on him</a>. Nonetheless, the Harlemite was then sentenced<a href=#> to 15 years to life in prison in 2012</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While some people were confused by Coleman’s decision to confess, his lawyer, Anthony L. Ricco, spoke about his client’s decision at the time. “He was in search of his redemption and his honor, and some might say that he achieved that,” Ricco said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Gov. Kathy Hochul then commuted his prison sentence in 2023, per <a href=# rel=nofollow>CBS</a>. Dep was released under the prison’s Limited Credit Time Allowance program. The program offers eligible prisoners a six-month credit on existing sentences. Hochul offered a statement at the time, speaking to Coleman and other prisoners’ “efforts to improve their lives.” “Through the clemency process, it is my solemn responsibility as governor to recognize the efforts individuals have made to improve their lives and show that redemption is possible,” Hochul’s statement read.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">G. Dep released his debut album,&nbsp;Child of the Ghetto, in 2001. The LP featured contributions from Black Rob, Joe Hooker, aka Harve Pierre, <a href=# id=auto-tag_diddy data-tag=diddy>Diddy</a>, Carl Thomas, Kool G Rap, Lady May, <a href=# id=auto-tag_loon data-tag=loon>Loon</a>, Rakim, <a href=# id=auto-tag_shyne data-tag=shyne>Shyne</a>, and more. G. Dep’s debut yielded two singles in “Let’s Get It” and the iconic “Special Delivery.” “Let’s Get It” peaked at No. 80 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;100, with “Special Delivery” peaking at No. 59 on the same chart. However, the LP peaked at No. 106 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;200. Diddy and Bad Boy weren’t feeling those numbers, and the rapper was eventually dropped from the label.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5x6pbHPZpyxZZKWsW6uzrJkmqqknsC1edGeo56Zo5qxbrzRoqqopl1mf3SAl29ub3BlZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bobby-lee-s-ex-girlfriend-khalyla-kuhn-changed-his-relationship-with-brendan-schaub-forever.html><span>←</span><span>Bobby Lee's Ex-Girlfriend Khalyla Kuhn Changed His Relationship With Brendan Schaub Forever</span></a>
