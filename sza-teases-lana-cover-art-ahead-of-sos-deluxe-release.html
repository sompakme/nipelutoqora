SZA, 34, posted six separate images via Instagram on Sunday, December 10, teasing her latest release. One showed the “Kill Bill” singer in a tent, while the other captured her giving Poison Ivy realness by wearing nothing but a plant bikini while out in a grassy field. SZA got in touch with wildlife in three other snaps, engaging in activities from holding a turkey to leading a horse and hanging with pigs and sheep."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

One showed the “Kill Bill” <a href=# rel=noopener>singer in a tent</a>, while the other captured her giving Poison Ivy realness by wearing nothing but a plant bikini while out in a grassy field. SZA got in touch with wildlife in three other snaps, engaging in activities from holding a turkey to leading a horse and hanging with <a href=# rel=noopener>pigs and sheep</a>. The last of the images had her dressed in all white (save her brown loafers) while sitting pretty on a folding chair.</p><p>The singer (real name Solána Imani Rowe) captioned each of the six posts with the word “LANA.” While some of her fans hoped that this heralded a collaboration with <strong>Lana Del Rey</strong>, the caption was actually the title of the deluxe edition of her 2022 album, SOS.</p><p>While the “<a href=#>Slime You Out</a>” hitmaker didn’t say when the project would drop, some fans speculated that she might have teased the release date in her Instagram posts. In three photos — the trio of pics with her alongside the barnyard denizens — SZA wore a blue football jersey bearing the number 15. December 15, 2023, is a Friday, the day that new albums are generally released on streaming services. If SZA doesn’t drop the album this Friday, the next Friday the 15th is in March 2024.</p><p>SZA announced the deluxe edition of SOS in September during a performance at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. She told her fans that the project would be called Lana due to her real name and would be “<a href=#>seven to 10 songs.</a>” At the time, she said the project would be “out this fall” and that this deluxe edition of her Grammy-nominated project would be “like a whole ‘nother album.”</p><p>During that performance, SZA said she was “just playing some songs off the deluxe, and we’re just going to play a couple of songs you already know. It was really just — I just wanted to do <a href=#>something</a> for free that was a vibe. ’Cause I was here in town. Literally, there’s no other point to this whatsoever.”</p><p>Many others have caught the vibe. On Sunday, SZA posted a tweet from @SzaOnStats to her Instagram Story, noting that Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, NPR, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times all named SOS as the No. 1 best album of 2023. (Though SOS was released in December 2022, the album was included in many of this year’s round-ups.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You don’t know what it’s like to come from begging [people] to hear [your] music to this,” SZA wrote of the critical acclaim. “I’m so f–king confused and grateful. Thank y’all. THANK GOD.”</p><p>In addition to the multiple year-end praises, SOS netted SZA nine nominations for the<a href=#> 66th Grammy Awards</a>, the most of any artist this year. She is up for Record of the Year (“Kill Bill”), Album of the Year, Song of the Year (“Kill Bill”), Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (“Ghost in the Machine” featuring <strong>Phoebe Bridgers</strong>), Best R&B Performance (“Kill Bill”), Best Traditional R&B Performance (“Love Language”), Best R&B Song (“Snooze”), Best Melodic Rap Performance (“Low”) and Best Progressive R&B Album.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqzmV2psqK%2FxKxkpZmelnqku9WeqWaZoql6orTEmptmp5ZiwLC%2FjJ2cpa2omnqzscuemKydXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./serial-podcast-top-serial-podcasts-in-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Serial Podcast Top Serial Podcasts in 2024</span></a>
