This is the reality for <strong>The Bachelorette stars Bryan Abasolo and Rachel Lindsay who announced their decision to split in 2023 but are reportedly still living under the same roof</strong>. To attempt to find a solution to this, Abasolo recently filed a motion requesting emergency spousal support, Us Weekly reports.</p><p>The documents claim that Abasolo does not have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">access to their marital finances</a>, which Lindsay is reportedly using. She doesn't "give [him] access to any of [their] community property funds" he claims, leaving him unable to use them for his expenses and legal bills.</p><h2 id=39-the-bachelorette-39-stars-bryan-abasolo-and-rachel-lindsay-still-living-together>'The Bachelorette' Stars Bryan Abasolo And Rachel Lindsay Still Living Together</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rachel-lindsay-and-bryan-abasolo-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The court documents obtained by Us Weekly also reveal that Bryan Abasolo and Rachel Lindsay are still living together, and it is far from an ideal situation. Abasolo said living with his ex in their North Hollywood home was "awkward and strained" and they "avoid" one another. "I want to move out of our Family Residence as soon as possible, but maintaining our standard of living is not financially feasible at this time."</p><p>He continued, "I placed my career as a chiropractor on hold to move twice for Rachel's career. These moves were detrimental to my chiropractic business, while Rachel's income and success as a media personality skyrocketed."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The couple announced their decision to break up in December 2023</strong>. Abasolo filed for divorce citing "irreconcilable differences." At the time, he also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made a statement about their situation</a> on Instagram. He started his post by informing fans that while he prefers to keep his life off social media, he wanted to let them of the latest developments in his marriage. "After more than 4 years of marriage, Rachel and I have made the difficult decision to part ways and start anew," he wrote.</p><p>Abasolo also discussed how he never saw divorce in his future, as his own parents are still together but "sometimes loving yourself and your partner means you must let go." He declined to share more about what went wrong, and he turned off the comments on the post.</p><h2 id=bryan-abasolo-and-rachel-lindsay-39-s-relationship-timeline>Bryan Abasolo And Rachel Lindsay's Relationship Timeline</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rachel-lindsay-and-bryan-abasolo.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bryan Abasolo and Rachel Lindsay met on Season 13 of The Bachelorette, and for many people, their love story looked to be one from the show that would actually last. The couple got engaged in the finale and later married in 2019.</p><p>Many questions have been raised about their relationship and what went wrong, and in January 2024, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Abasolo addressed this</a> on Instagram, per People. In response to a fan's question about the couple's separation, he wrote, "We've been living together for almost 3 years here in LA. I'm not sure why people think we've been apart this entire time."</p><p>He continued, "Yes, her career came first, but there were opportunities for her that were smart for her to take which could have not been offered later. I didn't have anything lined up for me in LA, but we were a team, so I closed up shop, uprooted, and opened up a new business in LA. It's not just women who should be expected to sacrifice, but a man can do it too."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZmpuYmrmwvsStq55lo6mus7%2BMnZytmZmheqLDxa6jZquZqcKiwMiopWagkau2r7OMpaCvnV2pvKix06Gcq2WRoralecOiraiqk5p6o63TraOeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./derrick-henry-stiff-arms-the-soul-out-of-josh-norman-instant-interne.html><span>←</span><span> Derrick Henry Stiff Arms The Soul Out Of Josh Norman, Instant Interne</span></a>
